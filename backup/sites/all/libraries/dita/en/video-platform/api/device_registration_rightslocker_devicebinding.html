 <h1 class="title topictitle1">Binding Viewer Devices to Entitlements</h1>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">To protect your assets and ensure that you realize all possible revenue, with Rights Locker in
      conjunction with the <a class="xref" href="../concepts/device_registration.html#concept_r24_32h_3k">Device Registration API</a>, you can
      programmatically bind the entitlements your viewers purchase to the viewers' devices.  This
      binding can prevent your customers from accessing content that they have not purchased.</p>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Relationship of Device Limits and Device Binding</h2>
      
      <p class="p">There are several different limits associated with  devices and device binding that interact with each other.</p>

    <ul class="ul" id="reightslocker_devicebinding__ul_ub4_3qm_kk">
        <li class="li">With the <a class="xref" href="../concepts/device_registration.html#concept_r24_32h_3k">Device Registration API</a> you can build a
          portal for your users or customer support to manage registered devices. An essential
          parameter is the <a class="xref" href="device_registration_properties.html#device_registration_properties__device_limit"><samp class="ph codeph"><span class="keyword parmname">device_limit</span></samp></a>: the upper bound on the
          number of devices each of your viewers can register. This setting is at the provider level
          and prevents multiple viewers from sharing the same account.</li>

        <li class="li">Rights Locker gives you the ability to "bind", or associate, the viewer's devices to
          your content via entitlements. The essential parameter is the allowable number of devices
          that can be bound: <span class="keyword parmname">num_devices_to_bind</span>. This setting is at the viewer
          level. For example, after a viewer purchases a video, once a viewer starts watching a
          purchased video on a particular device, the video is restricted to that specific device.
     </li>

    </ul>

      <p class="p">You can bind as many devices as is limited by the device registration <a class="xref" href="device_registration_properties.html#device_registration_properties__device_limit"><samp class="ph codeph"><span class="keyword parmname">device_limit</span></samp></a>.</p>

      <p class="p">These limits are shown graphically below.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><img class="image" id="reightslocker_devicebinding__image_z1b_mlm_kk" src="../image/device_limits_and_binding.png" height="319" width="624"/></div>

      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">On the left ("A") is the normal relationship: number of devices to bind is a subset of the overall device limit.</li>

        <li class="li">The right ("B") shows a case that is possible but that you should make sure to prevent.
        <p class="p">When you create a device-bound entitlement, Ooyala does not check the number of bindable devices against the upper limit of devices per provider.
          This is both for speed of performance and for separation of concern. Most logically, a device-bound entitlement is part of your checkout or purchasing process on your site.
          Ooyala has made the creation of entitlements simple to fit in with your checkout, but <em class="ph i">it is up to you to ensure that "Case B" shown above does not occur</em>, because at playback time, in "Case B", a viewer is denied authorization to access the asset.</p>
</li>

      </ul>

      Thus, in the design of your device registration portals and your checkout, you need to keep track of the counts of viewers' device such that "Case B" is avoided.

   <div class="p">The following use case illustrates a basic pattern in device binding. (As detailed in the
          <a class="xref" href="../concepts/device_registration.html#concept_r24_32h_3k">Device Registration API</a>, actual device registration is
        automatic. You do not need to make any explicit request.) <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Not included in this
          workflow is any necessary interaction with the device registration portal or with your
          checkout process.</div>
<ol class="ol">
          <li class="li">A viewer purchases a single-device movie.</li>

          <li class="li">You create an entitlement for that viewer, including
                <samp class="ph codeph"><span class="keyword parmname">num_devices_to_bind</span> = 1</samp>.</li>

          <li class="li">The viewer starts watching the movie on an iPhone.</li>

            <li class="li">The player application makes a request to Ooyala services for authorization, using the <a class="xref" href="../concepts/player_v3_authorization_api.html" title="The Authorization API request is a key element of Ooyala's content protection features.">Player Authorization API for Player V3</a>.</li>

          <li class="li">Ooyala services determine that the single-use entitlement has not yet been used and
            registers the iPhone for that entitlement.</li>

          <li class="li">The viewer tries to watch the same movie on a laptop.</li>

            <li class="li">The player application makes the authorization request, using the <a class="xref" href="../concepts/player_v3_authorization_api.html" title="The Authorization API request is a key element of Ooyala's content protection features.">Player Authorization API for Player V3</a>.</li>

          <li class="li">Ooyala services determine that the single-use entitlement has already been used and
            playback is <em class="ph i">not</em> authorized.</li>

  </div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Some Behavior to Consider</h2>
   
   <div class="p">Discussed below are some basic behaviors of device binding and some possible "corner cases" to
        take into consideration, including programmatic action (if any) you need to take.
              <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Context</strong>: The viewer has two entitlements:<ol class="ol" id="reightslocker_devicebinding__ol_fnv_mv5_3k">
              <li class="li">Asset-based entitlement restricting access to a single device</li>

              <li class="li">Label-based entitlement (that includes the asset in (1) using the viewer-level
                device restriction</li>

            </ol>
 The viewer has already registered the device for (2). <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Behavior or
                Result:</strong> When the viewer tries to watch the asset on the same device, playback is
              authorized but Ooyala does not re-register the device for entitlement (1).</p>
</li>

              </ul>

             
                <ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Context:</strong> A viewer has two entitlements:<ol class="ol" id="reightslocker_devicebinding__ol_lc2_tv5_3k">
              <li class="li">Asset-based entitlement that restricts access to a single device for this
                asset</li>

              <li class="li">Label-based entitlement (that includes the asset in (1) that uses the viewer-level
                device restriction</li>

            </ol>
<p class="p">The viewer is using a new, different device that has not been bound to either
              entitlement.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Behavior or Result:</strong> Ooyala binds the new device randomly to
              one and only one of the entitlements.</p>
</li>

                               </ul>

              
              <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Context:</strong> Single-device entitlements created based on a label
                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Behavior or Result:</strong> Because this restriction will require the viewer to
              use the same device to watch all the assets in that label, this usage is not
              recommended because it is a bad user experience.</p>

          </li>

              </ul>

              <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Context:</strong> Purchasing the same movie for two different single-device
            entitlements <p class="p">A viewer buys a single-device movie and watches it on his T-box. He also
              wants to watch this on his mobile phone, so he buys the movie a second
                time.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Your action:</strong> The first purchase results in
                  <samp class="ph codeph"><span class="keyword parmname">num_devices_to_bind</span> = 1</samp>. With the second
              purchase, you need to increase the viewer's existing entitlement. You first need to
              delete the existing entitlement and then create a new one with
                  <samp class="ph codeph"><span class="keyword parmname">num_devices_to_bind</span> = 2</samp>. This means that you
              must keep track of how many devices a viewer can register for an entitlement., as
              discussed in the introduction.</p>
