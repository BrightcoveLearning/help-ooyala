  <h1 class="title topictitle1">High Performance API (Deprecated)</h1>

  
  
 <div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">In addition to our standard API, Ooyala also offers a high performance caching layer for API requests.  </p>

   <div class="section">
     <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This software is deprecated. Use the latest version.</div>

     <p class="p">
       This caching layer may not be necessary for all applications, but it is ideal for the following cases:</p>

     <ul class="ul">
       <li class="li">Your application generates a large number of API requests</li>

       <li class="li">There a number of duplicate API requests such as each user generating the same query against a label</li>

     </ul>

     <p class="p">
       If these reflect your use case, we recommend using the high performance API.
     </p>

     
     <p class="p">High Performance API Usage</p>

     <p class="p">
       Here is what you need to know when using the high performance API:
     </p>

     <ol class="ol">
       <li class="li">API requests need to be made to <strong class="ph b">cdn-api.ooyala.com</strong> instead of api.ooyala.com.
       </li>

       <li class="li"><p class="p">While the high performance caching layer will keep a copy of your response for a few minutes, your expires parameter needs to be made "cache friendly." Unlike regular API requests where you'll often set the expires time to be just a few minutes from the current time, you'll find better performance setting it to a fixed time further out. For example, we can set it to always be the start of tomorrow with the following snippet:</p>

       <p class="p">
         <samp class="ph codeph">today = Date.today</samp>
         <samp class="ph codeph">expires = Time.mktime(today.year, today.month, today.day) + 86400
         </samp>
       </p>

         <p class="p">Alternatively, if you're generating urls to be used directly from a Flash / Flex application, you can simply pre-generate a url with an expires time years into the future.</p>

       </li>

       <li class="li">
         <p class="p">
         High Performance doesn't mean it is better in all cases. Caching queries to the CDN is ideal for repeated, non-unique requests, but if you're generating unique requests (i.e. from search terms) each and every time, you'll want to query Ooyala directly.
         </p>

       <p class="p">
         Additionally, in scenarios where you always need the most up to date response, and can't wait a few minutes for a cached response to return, you should use api.ooyala.com
       </p>

       </li>

     </ol>
