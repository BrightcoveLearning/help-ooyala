 Your Ooyala Backlot
                provider account can be configured to allow you to stop unauthorized streaming in
                realtime. Then, to stop unauthorized access to an asset as it is streaming, use
                Rights Locker to delete the entitlement or contact your Ooyala Customer Support
                Manager to do it for you. The deletion of the entitlement causes stream takedown to
                occur immediately.
