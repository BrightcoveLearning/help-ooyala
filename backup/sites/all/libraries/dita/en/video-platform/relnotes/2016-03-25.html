Access to certain Ooyala
                services, such as eCommerce and Watchlist, is controlled using an Ooyala Account
                Token. The Ooyala Account Token API generates an account token to authenticate a
                user. When calling these APIs, the client is required to provide the account token
                for authentication. After your application has logged in a user, it calls the Ooyala
                Account Token API route to get the account token. The account token is valid for a
                specific amount of time, 15 minutes by default.
