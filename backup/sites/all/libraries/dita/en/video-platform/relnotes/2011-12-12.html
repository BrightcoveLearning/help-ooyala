 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Updates include Android UI changes, Ooyala/VAST ads for authenticated streams, paywall
  full-screen, and rebuilt streams API.</p>

  <p class="p">The following are release items: </p>

  <ul class="ul">
   <li class="li">Android UI Changes—Ooyala has developed a new UI for Android tablets devices; the phone UI is no longer shown on desktops or large touchscreens. Less than 6” is treated as a phone, 6” to 13” is treated as a tablet, and over 13” is treated as a computer. This is an automatic change; no action is necessary on your part.</li>

   <li class="li">Ooyala/VAST Ads for Authenticated Streams (Token-based)—Ooyala/VAST ads now work for streams that have been authenticated using Ooyala’s Token-Based Authentication content protection. This is an automatic change; no action is necessary on your part.</li>

   <li class="li">Paywall Full-Screen—When viewers were in full-screen mode, the payment screen was hidden behind the video. Now, when customers pay, the player exits full screen mode so payment can be completed. This is an automatic change; no action is necessary on your part.</li>

   <li class="li">Rebuilt Streams API—You now have access to stream URLs for transcoded streams. This enables you to implement Download-to-own solutions and programmatically access transcoded content. For more information, go to the <a class="xref" href="../concepts/content_videos.html" title="When you upload a video to Ooyala, Ooyala automatically transcodes it using the settings specified for your account and makes the videos available for playback through your player.">Video</a>.</li>
