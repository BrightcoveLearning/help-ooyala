                <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">The OoyalaPlayer now emits Observable events differently than in the past.
                        Previously, the OoyalaPlayer would emit String objects from the
                        OoyalaPlayer's Observer Notifications. There are now additional
                        notifications that emit the <samp class="ph codeph">OoyalaNotification</samp> class. This
                        will not likely affect your existing code, but if it does, you will need to
                        modify the way you handle the <samp class="ph codeph">update()</samp> method to determine
                        the class of the notification.</li>

                    <li class="li">A new <samp class="ph codeph">OoyalaPlayer.getPCode()</samp> method has been added to the
                        Mobile SDK.</li>

                    <li class="li">Upon reaching the end of playback on a video, the
                            <span class="ph uicontrol">Discovery</span> tray will automatically load the next
                        video.</li>

                    <li class="li">A new <samp class="ph codeph">OoyalaPlayer.ClickAd()</samp> has been added to the Mobile
                        SDK. This method runs the <span class="ph uicontrol">Learn More</span> feature, opening
                        up the browser based on the advertisement being played.</li>

                    <li class="li">The Skin Sample App now includes FreeWheel and IMA functionality.</li>

                        clicking the back button or elsewhere on the screen. This issue has been
                        resolved.</li>
