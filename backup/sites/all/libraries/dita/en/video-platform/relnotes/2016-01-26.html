                <p class="p">You can now enable concurrent stream limits at the asset level and set the limit
                    with a Backlot API call. </p>

This feature discourages viewers from sharing their credentials with friends who don’t have accounts. If the viewer, or someone with their account credentials, tries to open an additional stream while the maximum number of streams is open, the player displays a message and refuses to open the stream. This default limit applies across all of the syndication groups (aka publishing rules) within your provider account. You change this limit, and you can enable or disable the limit on a per-group basis. You can also enable or disable this setting for the default group. You can change your Ooyala Backlot provider account limit. You can also set this type of limit at the asset level. For example, your provider account limit could be 3, and your asset-level limit could be 1. In this case, three friends or family members could log in using the same credentials and watch three different assets concurrently, but would be blocked from watching any particular asset concurrently.">Limiting Concurrent Streams per Viewer</a> for details on how this new feature works and an <a class="xref" href="../concepts/player_v3_concurrent_stream_limits.html#concept_ynm_ms5_3j__use_case">asset limit use case</a>. </p>
