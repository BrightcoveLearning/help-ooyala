            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Introducing the Usage RESTful API</strong></p>
<p class="p">You can use the Usage RESTful API to retrieve reports on any usage statisics (such as VOD bytes delivered, live bytes delivered, number of streams, and transcoded time) that are
                being collected for your account.</p>

            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The API routes in the Usage API are estimated representations of data utilization and may not match billed usage.</div>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Integration with Adways Studio</strong></p>

            <p class="p">Ooyala's integration with <a class="xref" href="http://www.adways-studio.com/" target="_blank">Adways Studio</a> enables you to enhance the
                playback experience for Ooyala-hosted videos. Adways Studio is a cloud-based
                authoring tool that allows you to add overlays and clickable hotspots to your video
                content to provide your users with engaging, interactive experiences. For more
                information on using this integration, please contact your Customer Success Manager.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Ingest via Integration with Avid Technologies</strong></p>

            <p class="p">For Ooyala customers, integration with Avid Technologies allows Avid users to push
                content directly from their <a class="xref" href="https://www.avid.com/US/Products/MediaSuite/index.html" target="_blank">Media Suite</a> into Backlot. For more
                information on using this integration, please contact your Customer Success Manager.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Known Issues</h2>
            
            <p class="p">For the Ooyala Player V3 integration with NPAW YOUBORA, for IE 10+ and Explored Edge
                (v 11.x) playback, when failures occur during player load or initial playback,
                events can be sequenced out of order. This can cause YOUBORA to pick up data
                unexpectedly. For example, the title dimension can be reported as undefined and CDN
                attributes can be reported as unknown. This issue is intermittent.</p>

            <p class="p">For Flash, the Google DFP ad server sometimes returns an empty VPAID tag for DoubleClick ads. Per Google, this is a problem on the ad server side (DFP). On the DFP side, frequency capping can be applied to control how often an ad would serve. Please work with Google IMA on how to correctly set up ad serving to prevent this from happening.</p>

This feature discourages viewers from sharing their credentials with friends who donâ€™t have accounts. If the viewer, or someone with their account credentials, tries to open an additional stream while the maximum number of streams is open, the player displays a message and refuses to open the stream. This default limit applies across all of the syndication groups (aka publishing rules) within your provider account. You change this limit, and you can enable or disable the limit on a per-group basis. You can also enable or disable this setting for the default group. You can change your Ooyala Backlot provider account limit. You can also set this type of limit at the asset level. For example, your provider account limit could be 3, and your asset-level limit could be 1. In this case, three friends or family members could log in using the same credentials and watch three different assets concurrently, but would be blocked from watching any particular asset concurrently.">Limiting Concurrent Streams per Viewer</a>: Added documentation on the configurable heartbeat interval and heartbeat latency.</li>
