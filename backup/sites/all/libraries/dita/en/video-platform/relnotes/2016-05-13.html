        update about the Android SDK.</p>
 
        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Android SDK Update: Moving to Google ExoPlayer Libraries</h2>
            
            <div class="note warning"><span class="warningtitle">Warning:</span> 
                <p class="p" id="release20160513__visualon1">As of April 1, 2016 the Ooyala Android SDKs have been shipping with
                    Google ExoPlayer libraries instead of the VisualOn libraries. While there are steps
                    that you will need to take, moving to ExoPlayer will provide a more consistent,
                    higher quality HLS and MPEG-DASH playback experience for VOD and live streams on
                    Android devices.</p>

                <p class="p" id="release20160513__visualon2">As of August 1, 2016, Ooyala will no longer support the HLS player
                    integration with VisualOn or provide bug fixes or improvements specific to
                    VisualOn libraries. </p>

                <div class="p" id="release20160513__visualon3">In order to upgrade, you will need to <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">Download the latest Android SDK
                        4.13.0+ (available at <span class="ph">Ooyala <a class="xref" href="../../../../../../../downloads.html" target="_blank">Downloads</a></span>) to start your integration.</li>

                    <li class="li">Follow the integration instructions in <a class="xref" href="../concepts/android_exoplayer.html">Integration with Google ExoPlayer on Android</a>.</li>

                    <li class="li">Recompile your application and submit to Google Play Store.</li>

                </ul>

                </div>

                <p class="p">You should upgrade to the latest Ooyala Android SDKs by August 1st to ensure you
                    receive updates and fixes to your Android SDKs. </p>

                <div class="p">The move to Google ExoPlayer provides the following advantages: <ul class="ul" id="release20160513__ul_t4g_tmq_yv">
                    <li class="li">ExoPlayer HLS library is designed to solve the complex problems associated
                        with HLS video streaming in the world of Android.</li>

                    <li class="li">ExoPlayer is available out-of-the-box with Ooyala Android SDKs.</li>

                    <li class="li">Google ExoPlayer provides MPEG-DASH, WebM, MP4, and M4A playback support on
                        Android.</li>

                    <li class="li">With the latest Android SDK upgrade, you can very easily create native apps
                        that provide wider coverage for video streaming, core playback and
                        advertising functionalities thereby creating more ROI with building native
                        apps over plain browser based experiences.</li>

                    <li class="li">With Google ExoPlayer integration, the Ooyala Android SDK also now supports
                        studio-approved Widevine Modular DRM for premium content using
                        MPEG-DASH.</li>

                </ul>

                </div>

                <p class="p">If you have any questions about the move to Google ExoPlayer, please contact your
                    Ooyala point of contact or Brightcove Technical Support.</p>
