                        Players</strong>
                </p>

                <div class="p">Ooyala IQ can provide metrics for: <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">An Ooyala player playing Ooyala assets (hosted in Backlot).</li>

                </ul>

            </div>

                <div class="p">You can configure if you want to use the third-party player to play a Backlot
                    asset or play a third-party CMS-hosted asset. The following examples show how to
                    specify content type with the Ooyala-JW Player adapter.<ul class="ul">
                           <li class="li"><strong class="ph b"><samp class="ph codeph">OOYALA_CONTENT</samp></strong>: Indicates that the
                                        <samp class="ph codeph">mediaid</samp> is an Ooyala embed code. To get the
                                    information you need to specify the Ooyala asset, make the
                                    Backlot API query: <samp class="ph codeph">/assets/&lt;ASSET EMBED
                                        CODE&gt;/streams</samp> for the asset and copy the result of
                                    the desired encoding. The example below shows how
                                        <samp class="ph codeph">OOYALA_CONTENT</samp> is specified with the JW

                                    customer-defined media ID from a non-Ooyala CMS). The example
                                    below shows how <samp class="ph codeph">EXTERNAL_CONTENT</samp> is specified
                                    with the JW Player adapter.<pre class="pre codeblock" id="release20160210__d42991e284">&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;

                <div class="p">For Ooyala assets (hosted in Backlot), you can now view Ooyala IQ analytics
                    metrics for video assets played in third-party video players, such as JW Player.
                    The key steps for enabling IQ analytics metrics for video assets played in
                    third-party video players are: <ol class="ol">
                        <li class="li">Enable your third-party player to communicate player events to Ooyala IQ
                            by integrating the Ooyala IQ JavaScript SDK with your non-<span class="ph">Ooyala</span> video players by using one of the Ooyala
                            out-of-the-box adapters or by building your own adapter. </li>

                        <li class="li">Make sure that your Ooyala assets are playable on third-party players by
                            checking that your video assets are .mp4 files and that you have the
                            correct encoding profile to allow .mp4 files to be encoded.</li>

                        <li class="li">Create your third-party player, making sure to reference the URL to your
                            .mp4 video asset, the asset's embed code, and to specify the asset type
                            as mp4.</li>

                    </ol>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Mixed Player Support in Ooyala IQ </strong>
                </p>

                <p class="p"><span class="ph" id="release20160210__mixed_player">If you are using Ooyala players and third-party players to
                        play Ooyala video assets (hosted in Backlot), you can now use one Backlot
                        account to stream video to an Ooyala player and a third-party player. You
                        can view consolidated IQ analytics metrics in one dashboard (through one
                        user account) for both types of players.</span>

                <p class="p">Please note that for third-party assets (hosted in a third-party CMS), you will
                    still need to set up a separate Backlot provider account to ingest asset
                    metadata.</p>

                    with the "filter by label" feature. We have also enhanced the Business

                <p class="p">Ooyala IQ now tracks Chromecast device plays. You can monitor Chromecast receiver
                analytics with the Ooyala IQ API by looking at data for browser=chrome,
                deviceOs=chromecast, and deviceType=settop. In the Ooyala IQ UI this will be under
                Device Type &gt; settop &gt; other - Chromecast. In the Player panel, you will see
                "Chromecast_player" for Chromecast players. Analytics results will vary depending on
                which cast/play scenario the end user initiates.</p>

                <p class="p">This feature was released in January. See <a class="xref" href="../concepts/chromecast_analytics.html">Chromecast Integration Analytics</a> for details.</p>
