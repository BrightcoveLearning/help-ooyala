            <p class="p">This release includes new Backlot API routes for managing remote movie asset URLs. A
                movie URL is a URL that a video player will need in order to play the remote movie.
                You must identify a URL for each format you have created for the movie. A movie
                asset can have multiple formats so it can play on multiple devices, such as HLS for
                mobile devices and HDS for desktop. See <a class="xref" href="../api/asset_url.html" title="For a video asset that is remote, you must identify a URL for each format you have created for the movie. A video asset can have multiple formats so it can play on multiple devices, such as HLS for mobile devices and HDS for desktop.">Adding URLs for an Asset</a> for more details on these new API routes.</p>
