                    <li class="li" id="release20150824__PBA-2195">An issue where the user would switch to fullscreen mode in
                        landscape mode, then change orientation to portrait, and the player's
                        control bar would overlap device's status bar is now resolved.</li>

                    <li class="li" id="release20150824__PBA-2202">An issue where the user could only dismiss controls by tapping
                        video after switching to fullscreen  has been fixed and the controls will

            <p class="p">The following issues are resolved in this release:</p>

            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li" id="release20150824__PBA-2229">A null pointer exception around video authorization issue has been
                    fixed.</li>

                <li class="li" id="release20150824__PBA-2231">An issue occurs if <samp class="ph codeph">changeCurrentItem</samp> is used with a null
                    parameter. A crash may result. To avoid this issue, use <samp class="ph codeph">setEmbedCode</samp> instead of
                    <samp class="ph codeph">changeCurrentItem</samp>.</li>

                <li class="li" id="release20150824__PBA-2251">An issue would occur where when the close caption (CC) option was
                    selected and the device was subsequently rotated, the CC icon would be
                    deselected. This has been fixed and the CC icon will remain selected after the
                    device is rotated.</li>

                <li class="li" id="release20150824__PBA-2272">An issue would occur where when the closed caption (CC) option was
                    selected and <samp class="ph codeph">MediaListView</samp> was subsequently selected, the app would crash. This
                    behavior has been fixed and the app no longer crashes.</li>

                <li class="li" id="release20150824__PBA-1969">An issue would occur when playing a video in both Play and Cast
                    and Cast and Play scenarios with Chromecast. The Closed Captions button
                    displaying options of None and Use Closed Captions did not appear. This issue
                    has been fixed and the Closed Captions button now appears.</li>
