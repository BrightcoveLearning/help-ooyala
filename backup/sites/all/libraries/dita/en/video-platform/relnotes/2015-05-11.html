    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Notable changes for this release include the documentation for Ooyala IQ, Ooyala's
        new analytics product. </p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The New Ooyala Analytics Product: Ooyala IQ</h2>
            
            <div class="sectiondiv">
            <p class="p">Ooyala IQ is Ooyala’s new video analytics product built on top of our reliable,
                robust, and scalable big data architecture, providing real-time analytics as well as
                multi-dimensional analytics capability to give a full 360-degree view of video
                consumption and engagement patterns. It is a major upgrade to the existing Ooyala
                Analytics product and will be available for all Ooyala customers at no additional
                cost.</p>

            <div class="p">The following capabilities are new: <ol class="ol">
                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Newly designed user interface built in HTML:</strong>
                        <p class="p">The new HTML UI removes the reliance on a Flash plugin, provides the
                            ability to access IQ on various devices (e.g. iPad), and offers
                            performance improvements.</p>
</li>

                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">New multi-dimensional analytics capability:</strong>
                        <p class="p">With Ooyala’s new multi-dimensional querying capability, you can now run
                            analytics across multiple dimensions, including Device Type (e.g.
                            Mobile, Tablet, Desktop, Set-top Box, etc.), OS/Browser, Geography
                            (Country, Region, State/Province, DMA), Domain, Player, Asset or Label.
                            This will help address your more complex business questions such as “How
                            many unique viewers from the United States and Canada do I have for a
                            subset of videos consumed on Tablet - iOS during the last
                        month”?</p>
</li>

                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">New Video Details page:</strong>
                        <p class="p">The new Video Details page will give you a holistic, detailed view into
                            the performance of an asset. Apart from uniques and engagement data,
                            you’ll now be able to view key asset metadata, key performance metrics
                            for the asset, and asset consumption broken down by each dimension. You
                            can access the Video Details page directly from either the Dashboard or
                            the Business Intelligence page simply by clicking on the asset. This
                            increased accessibility, along with detailed performance of a specific
                            asset, allows you to quickly identify consumption and engagement
                            patterns for that asset.</p>
</li>

                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Real-time statistics for top 10 videos:</strong>
                        <p class="p">The new real-time Dashboard in Ooyala IQ will show you the top 10 videos
                            and their viewership data in real-time, while the old analytics product
                            only shows the top 3 videos in real-time.</p>
</li>

                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Improved reporting:</strong>
                        <ul class="ul">
                            <li class="li">Metrics are more accurately defined and calculated;</li>

                            <li class="li">Geography and device reporting are provided via more accurate
                                technologies;</li>

                            <li class="li">Algorithms for counting unique users are improved and reporting of
                                unique users now span a longer date range;</li>


                        </ul>

                        <p class="p">Overall, Ooyala IQ is built on more robust, scalable and performant big
                            data architecture.</p>
</li>

                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">New metrics and new dimensions:</strong>
                        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Video Starts.</strong> “Video Starts” indicate when the actual video
                            content starts playing. If pre-roll ads are played, a “video start”
                            would only be counted when all pre-roll ads are completed and the actual
                            video content starts playing. By comparing Plays Requested (referred to
                            as Plays in the old v2 analytics) and Video Starts, you will be able to
                            see the viewer drop-off due to pre-roll ads.</p>

                        <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">Player Dimension.</strong> The Player dimension can be used in multiple
                            ways. Players can be used to report: <ol class="ol" type="a">
                                <li class="li">The playback metrics for syndication partners (by creating a
                                    player for each syndication partner you wish to track).</li>

                                <li class="li">Performance within different sections of your website (by
                                    creating a player for each section).</li>

                                <li class="li">Performance due to a change in the player (by creating players
                                    with and without the player configuration such as different ad
                                    load, enablement of the Discovery content recommendation tool,
                                    or simply a change to the player UI).</li>
