 <h1 class="title topictitle1">2012-04-16 Release</h1>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Updates include new Backlot SDKs, new mobile SDKs, correct processing of 5.1 channel
  audio, support for negative timestamps, a fix for storing audio assets in multiple locations, and
  a fix for creating audio-only HLS streams.</p>

  <p class="p">The following are release items: </p>

  <ul class="ul">
   <li class="li">New Backlot SDKs— we now have Backlot SDKs in five programming languages (Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, and C#).</li>

   
   <li class="li">New Mobile SDKs—The Android, iOS, and Adobe AIR SDKs are now available.</li>

   
   <li class="li">5.1 channel audio now processes correctly—Previously, 5.1 channel audio did not process correctly. Now, you can upload 5.1 channel video and audio files, which are automatically converted to stereo. This is an automatic change and does not require any action on your part.</li>

   
   <li class="li">Negative timestamp support—Previously, negative videos with negative timestamps (typically iOS devices) were rejected during transcoding. We now support videos that have negative timestamps. This is an automatic change and does not require any action on your part.</li>


   <li class="li">Fix for storing audio assets in multiple locations—For customers that used non-Ooyala storage, audio-only assets did not process correctly. Now, audio-only assets are supported for all customers. This is an automatic change and does not require any action on your part.</li>

   
   <li class="li">Fix for creating audio-only HLS streams—Video assets that had no audio track would fail for HLS streams. These assets are now processed correctly. This is an automatic change and does not require any action on your part.</li>

   
  </ul>
