                <p class="p">Ooyala already empowers the Chromecast experience by integrating our V3 HTML5
                    player with Google Media Library v.1.0.0 which you can start leveraging.
                    To deploy Ooyala’s Chromecast solution, you can collaborate with Ooyala to build
                    our customized Sender-Receiver experience. Sender and Receiver applications are
                    to be built in partnership with Ooyala or 3rd party developers, integrating
                    these applications with Ooyala desktop, mobile SDKs (only required for
                    mobile-based Senders) and V3 HTML5 player (Receiver). Please contact your
                    Customer Success Manager for sample sender and receiver applications and more
                    information on deploying Ooyala's Chromecast solution. </p>

                <p class="p">The sender application is the application of the ‘primary’ viewing device and is
                    responsible for locating nearby Chromecast devices.</p>

                <p class="p">Build your own sender application that integrates with <a class="xref" href="../concepts/sdk_overview.html" title="Ooyala provides mobile SDKs for Android and iOS to enable you to integrate your content with other environments and services.">Ooyala's Mobile
                        SDKs</a>. Please see Google's <a class="xref" href="https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/sender_apps" target="_blank">Sender App Development </a> documentation to
                    learn how to develop your own sender application.</p>

                <div class="p">We recommend that your sender application uses the <a class="xref" href="https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/reference/receiver/cast.receiver.CastMessageBus" target="_blank">Cast Message Bus</a> via the
                    Google Cast Custom Channel namespace to facilitate the following: <ul class="ul">
                        <li class="li">Transmits the embed_code, player_branding_id and OPT (optional if OPT is
                            enabled in Backlot) to the Receiver application for launch of the Ooyala
                            HTML5 player.</li>

                        <li class="li">Transmits basic player functions (stop, play, pause etc) to the Receiver
                            application to control the Ooyala HTML5 player.</li>

                        <li class="li">Via Custom Channel Listener, receives Ooyala-related player errors based
                            on player message bus events and translates them to application-friendly
                            user messages. An example use case is if the Ooyala Device Management
                            feature is used. The /last_Result messages are published in the player
                            message bus and passed back to the Sender. Based on these results, the
                            appropriate message is passed back to the application.</li>
