      <p class="p" id="syndication_youtube__docs-internal-guid-9158b253-aa3c-ee0f-1c83-05ca91991693">You can syndicate content to
        your YouTube channel in Backlot using your Google YouTube login account. We use the OAuth
        2.0 protocol to authorize Backlot users to publish (syndicate) videos to YouTube. With this
        type of authorization, you can login to your Backlot account, click Authorize and login to
        your Google YouTube account in a pop-up window. Once you login to your Google YouTube
        account, you click OK and start exporting your Backlot videos (syndication) to YouTube.</p>

      <p class="p">For YouTube syndication (that is, exporting videos to YouTube), <span class="ph">Backlot</span> automatically uploads the source files of videos directly
        to YouTube, which handles all transcoding and the generation of preview images.</p>

      <div class="fig fignone">
        <img class="image" src="../image/youtube_syndication.png"/>
      </div>

      <p class="p">Syndication with YouTube is "one-way": your settings and content on <span class="ph">Backlot</span> are pushed to YouTube, but settings and content on
        YouTube are <em class="ph i">not</em> pulled to <span class="ph">Backlot</span>.</p>

      <p class="p">In Backlot we link a syndication feed to a YouTube channel through a YouTube login account.
        When you set up a syndication feed, Backlot prompts you to select a YouTube account to
        authorize the feed. If you have multiple:</p>

      <ul class="ul" id="syndication_youtube__ul_bjt_2c1_yn">
        <li class="li">
          <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">YouTube login accounts</strong>, Backlot displays a window listing your accounts and
            prompts you to select one of account for authorizing the syndication feed. </p>

        </li>

        <li class="li">
          <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">YouTube channels</strong> associated with a YouTube account, Backlot displays a window
            listing your channels and prompts you to select one of the channels for the syndication
            feed.</p>

        </li>

      </ul>

      <p class="p"> If you select the same YouTube account login for another syndication feed, Backlot prompts
        you to use a different account login. You can remove the link between a Backlot syndication
        feed and an authorized YouTube login account and authorize a different YouTube login account
        for the syndication. See the topic, “Choosing Other YouTube Accounts for Syndication” for
        important information about this option.</p>

      <p class="p">The following, “Selecting From Multiple YouTube Accounts” topic, provides more details
        about the relationship between the Backlot syndication, the OAuth-based account
        authorization, and handling multiple YouTube accounts and channels.</p>

      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> When you syndicate videos to YouTube, each video is assigned a YouTube video ID. The
        video and its unique id are linked. You cannot change this ID or give an uploaded video a
        new ID. Changes you make in Backlot to your video metadata (title and description) do not
        have any impact on the video ID.  Only uploading a new video triggers the creation of an
        associated video ID with that asset.</div>

        syndication privacy settings: public or private. In Backlot, when you set up a syndication

      </ul>
<ul class="ul" id="syndication_youtube__ul_yvg_321_yn">
        <li class="li">Changing the privacy setting affects only videos added to the syndication after the

      </ul>
<p class="p">You can also mark an individual asset with a public or private setting in the Backlot
        Manage tab. Settings at the asset level override the settings at the syndication feed.</p>

      To change the privacy setting on videos previously syndicated to YouTube, change the setting
      on the individual asset in the MANAGE page, Details <p class="p"> subtab for the specific asset, as
        shown in the following example.</p>

      <p class="p">In YouTube, with each login account that you create, you get an implicit default channel.
        You can also create more channels or a YouTube channel manager can give a YouTube user
        access to manage a channel. After authorizing a syndication through your YouTube account
        login, if you have multiple channels Backlot displays another window to let you select a
        channel for the syndication. The following image shows an example of the Backlot window that

      <p class="p">If you do have multiple Google YouTube account logins, when you click Authorize, Backlot
        will list all of your known Google YouTube accounts. The previous figure illustrates the pop
        up window showing a user with multiple Google YouTube login accounts. Select one account and
        follow the steps to complete the syndication. See the following topic, “Steps to Syndicate

        you do so, you cannot modify the original videos that you uploaded to YouTube under the
        previous account. When you switch accounts, all videos uploaded on the previous account stay
        on YouTube but they will be un-managed. These videos (and any new videos) will be uploaded
        separately from Backlot to the other YouTube account and will have new videoIDs.If you do

      <p class="p">Backlot supports linking a syndication feed to a single YouTube channel. Only one
        syndication feed can manage that channel (even if the syndication is authenticated through
        different YouTube accounts). Backlot allows you to switch from one YouTube account to
        another and still continue to manage the video assets. You can do this if (and only if) both

        such that you cannot directly replace the content of a previously uploaded (or syndicated)
        video. Only new video content is assigned a new identifier (ID) by YouTube. If you want to
        remove syndicated videos uploaded to YouTube and replace them, you need to delete them from
        within YouTube or use the Backlot remove labels option to delete them. All uploaded content
        will be assigned new YouTube video IDs. </p>

        data associated with the deleted videos. Youtube feeds also expire after 3 days.</div>
