  <div class="section context">
   <p class="p">Embeds contain specific players and playlists of your choosing. You can also set whether the
        width of the player is fluid or fixed. Once the embed is created, you are given lines of
        JavaScript to put the Theme Builder embed in a web page.</p>

   <p class="p">To create an embed:</p>

    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Fluid</strong>: The term <em class="ph i">fluid</em> means that the player and playlist adapt themselves to
      the width of the container (<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;div&gt;</samp> or other container) on the HTML page you
      embed them in.</p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Fixed</strong>: The term <em class="ph i">fixed</em> means a specific set width. If you select <span class="ph uicontrol">Fixed</span>,

    <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> With the Theme Builder setting of <span class="ph uicontrol">fluid</span>, the width of your player

            in the player itself (which is the setting <span class="ph uicontrol">fixed</span>). Therefore,
            with fluid, you need to set a specific width and height on the parent
              <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;div&gt;</samp> container of the Theme Builder embed, as in the following
            example. Otherwise, the fluid player does not have a width to adapt
