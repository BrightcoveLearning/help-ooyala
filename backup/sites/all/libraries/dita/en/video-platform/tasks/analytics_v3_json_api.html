            <p class="p" id="analytics_v3_json_api__overview">Use the new <span class="ph">Ooyala IQ</span> JSON API to communicate
                your third-party player's events to Ooyala IQ. You can use this endpoint to send
                JSON data to Ooyala IQ or you can use one of the out-of-the-box SDKs. For this
                release, we are offering an out-of-the-box SDK for Roku. </p>

            <p class="p" id="analytics_v3_json_api__roku_overview">The Ooyala IQ SDK for Roku sends JSON data to the Ooyala JSON API
                endpoint and automatically follows the best practices for what events should be sent
                when, and makes sure that all required fields are present. We recommend using the
                Ooyala IQ SDK for Roku with your Roku integrations, as it makes the Ooyala IQ
                implementation easier. For more details on the Ooyala IQ SDK for Roku, see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/analytics_v3_roku_sdk.html">Ooyala IQ SDK for Roku Integration</a>.</p>

                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">playerLoad</strong>: Called when the player has first
                        loaded.</li>

                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">display</strong>: Called when the media is ready (title,
                        description, other metadata). This may or may not include the video itself.
                        This is equivalent to the display metric in <span class="ph">Ooyala

                        content starts playing.</li>

                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">bucketWatched</strong>: Called to capture which part of the
                        video the viewer has watched (position dependent). The video is divided into
                        40 buckets. If the viewer watches the first bucket of the video (0-2.5%) and
                        then skips to the last bucket (97.5-100%) and watches it, you should send
                        two bucket watched events [0-2.5%] and [97.5%-100%]. <p class="p">There are 40
                            buckets, where each bucket is of size 25 denoting 2.5%. If the viewer
                            watches the same part (bucket) of the video again and again, that
                            viewing event should be sent each time it is watched (the player should
                            not de-duplicate views of the same part of the video). For example, if a
                            viewer watches the 2.5% - 5% bucket over and over again for 5 times, you
                            should send the event 5 times.</p>
<p class="p">This metric is per-mille, with the
                            payload being from and to of the bucket. There are 40 buckets total for
                            a video, where each bucket is of size 25 denoting 2.5%. If you see from:
                            1 and to: 25, that means the viewer has watched bucket number
                        1.</p>
</li>

                        quartile (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) of the media. This indicates that the user
                        has reached the % completion via seeking to the quartile or watching the
                        video. Once a playthrough event has been generated, rewinding the video
                        should not resend the playthrough event for that quartile.</li>

                        divided into 40 buckets. If the viewer watches the first bucket of the video
                        (0-2.5%) and then skips to the last bucket (97.5-100%) and watches it, you
                        should send two percentage watched events [0-2.5%] and [2.5%-5%]. <p class="p">If the

                            viewing event should only be sent once (it’s the player’s responsibility
                            to de-duplicate views of the same part of the video). If you add all the
                            percentage watched for a viewer while they were watching a video, it
                            should always be  &lt;= 100%. </p>
<p class="p">This metric is per-mille,

                    specific metadata and your player's event data to the Ooyala IQ JSON API
                    endpoint. For this release, we support an out-of-the-box SDK for Roku. For more
                    details on the Ooyala IQ SDK for Roku, see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/analytics_v3_roku_sdk.html">Ooyala IQ SDK for Roku Integration</a>.</span>

                        engagement, at a cost. Alternatively, you can create your own SDK to hit the
                        JSON API endpoint directly. If you create an SDK, you will need to host
                        it.</p>

                    <p class="p">If you create an SDK, the SDK must report certain events and information in a
