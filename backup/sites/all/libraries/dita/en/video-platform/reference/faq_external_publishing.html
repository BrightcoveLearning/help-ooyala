        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">YouTube</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: My videos are not posting to YouTube. What is happening?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> There might be ingestion delays from YouTube, especially for larger videos.
                If there doesn't appear to be an ingestion delay, there are several potential
                causes. First, check whether the videos are labeled correctly and whether they are
                marked as private. Then, check the YouTube length and size restriction. By default,
                videos cannot be larger than 64GB in size and 15 minutes in length. If you need to
                publish larger videos to YouTube, contact Technical Support. For more information
                about YouTube, see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/content_videosyoutube.html" title="A YouTube video is a video hosted by YouTube and played through the Ooyala player.">YouTube Videos</a>.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Should I remove the label from the YouTube feed and assign it again?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> If you remove a label from a video in Backlot and the label is used to
                syndicate the video to YouTube, the video will be deleted from YouTube. If you
                reassign the label, it will be created as a new YouTube video.</p>

            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If the video is deleted from YouTube, you will lose all YouTube analytics for the
                video.</div>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What is the character limit on metadata for YouTube Syndicated Videos?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> For Backlot metadata, the name field limit is 128 characters and there is
                no limit on the value field. For YouTube metadata, there is no limit. The YouTube
                title is limited to 50 characters (including spaces), the YouTube tags are limited
                to 120 characters, and the description is limited to 5000 characters.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Can I send YouTube Live Streams to Backlot?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> No.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Why can't I monetize YouTube assets?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Google controls monetization for YouTube assets and does not currently
                allow third-party monetization.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">YouTube Setup</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: If I change the credentials for my YouTube account, will my videos be deleted
                    from YouTube? </strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> yes, even if you only change the password. For example, if you log in to
                YouTube and change the password, syndication stops. Then, after you go to Backlot to
                update the password, all videos are deleted form YouTube and re-syndicated.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: If I change YouTube syndication from all of my content to selected labels, will
                    my videos be deleted from YouTube?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Yes. All videos are deleted from YouTube and re-syndicated.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Can I send my videos to multiple YouTube channels?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> No. The syndication will be sent to the account's main channel. However,
                you can upload videos to multiple YouTube accounts, but you must have one External
                Publishing syndication for each YouTube account.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Stream Download</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How can I download my source files?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> You can get the source files using the streams APIs
                (/v2/assets/asset_id/streams) or through an MRSS feed. To use the stream APIs, see
                    <a class="xref" href="../tasks/api_video_streams.html" title="Based on your account settings, videos are transcoded using different resolutions, codecs, and bit rates.">Viewing Video Stream
                    Information</a>. To create a Source MRSS feed, see <a class="xref" href="../api/syndications.html" title="A syndication consists of a list of content and a destination to which you want to syndicate the content.">Syndications for Developers</a> or
                    <a class="xref" href="../api/syndications.html" title="A syndication consists of a list of content and a destination to which you want to syndicate the content.">Syndications for Users</a>.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How can I get an mp4 progressive download URL? </strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> You can get an encoded mp4 URL through an MP4 MRSS feed.</p>

            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Your profile must be configured to encode MP4s. Depending on your account setup,
                different bit rates might be available. </div>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: I downloaded my source file, but the filename is completely different. What
                    happened?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Depending on how the source file was downloaded, it might have a different
                name and it will not have a file extension. However, you can get the original
                filename and extension by looking at the page source for the feed or through the
                API. For information on getting the filename through the API, see <a class="xref" href="../api/asset_video.html" title="When you upload a video to Ooyala, Ooyala automatically transcodes it using the settings specified for your account and makes the videos available for playback through your player.">Video and Audio Assets</a>.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Does Analytics track URL stream downloads?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Not at this time.</p>

            
        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">MRSS</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Are MRSS feed downloads reflected in Analytics?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> MRSS downloads are not tracked at this time. With the exception of the
                Player MRSS feeds (which use our Player), no MRSS analytics can be captured.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Will MRSS feeds respect my Syndication restrictions?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Because the files are not played through the Ooyala Player, the syndication
                restrictions might not be respected. If the player is designed to respect
                restrictions, it can get them from the feed.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What stream is selected for Podcasts?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Podcasts use MP4 video only.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Can I create an audio feed?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> No. Ooyala feeds do not support audio assets at this time.</p>

            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How do I limit my feed's results to a certain number?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> To limit the results, use the limit parameter. See <a class="xref" href="../api/syndications.html" title="A syndication consists of a list of content and a destination to which you want to syndicate the content.">Syndications</a> for more
                information.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Can I configure the results of a feed to be ordered by name?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> No, feeds are returned from newest to oldest. </p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Can I use a Source MRSS feed to ingest into another Backlot account?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Yes. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/ingestion_mrss.html" title="You can use Media RSS (MRSS) to have Ooyala pull your content from your own system from an MRSS feed that you publish. Backlot pulls the metadata from the MRSS feed and either creates a remote asset or downloads (from where they are hosted) and processes the videos and any associated files (thumbnails, closed caption files, etc.).">MRSS</a>.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Why do feeds expire? How can I work around it?</strong></p>

            <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> To prevent limitless download URLs, the feeds expire every 10 minutes. By
                default, universal feeds are fixed to expire after 600 seconds. As a result, you
                will need to periodically request the feed to generate current URLs. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> You can
                    change expiration time for universal syndication feeds using apis.</div>

                Although it's not recommended, you can set feeds to expire at intervals up to one
                year. Youtube and universal feeds cannot be set to expire after longer intervals. To
                set longer expiration periods, contact Technical Support.</div>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Why do feeds have re-directs? Can you display the actual URL?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> By default, the syndications contain redirect URLs. When a viewer clicks on
                a video, the default setting is to redirect the user to the permanent URL where the
                video is embedded. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Pagination</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: I'm only getting 500 results but I have over 500 assets. Why is this
                    happening?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Ooyala MRSS feeds are limited to 500 assets. If you have over 500 assets,
                you will need to use the next_page token parameter to retrieve the rest.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How can I paginate my content?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Use the next_page token.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What is the next_page token?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> You might want to break a feed into smaller numbers of results. For
                example, you might only want the latest 10 videos. The next_page token enables you
                to page through the results. See <a class="xref" href="../api/syndications.html" title="A syndication consists of a list of content and a destination to which you want to syndicate the content.">Syndications</a> for more
                information.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How do I generate the next_page token?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> If there are more results than returned in the request, the response
                automatically includes the next_page token. See <a class="xref" href="../api/syndications.html" title="A syndication consists of a list of content and a destination to which you want to syndicate the content.">Syndications</a> for more
                information.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Where do I add the next_page token?</strong></p>

            <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Make another request that specifies the page token returned from the
                previous request. For example:
                <pre class="pre codeblock">[GET]/v2/syndications?limit=5&amp;page_token=paging token</pre>
</div>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Do I need to re-generate the signature including the next_token?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Yes. Create a new request that contains the page_token query string
                parameter and sign it as you normally would. See <a class="xref" href="../api/syndications.html" title="A syndication consists of a list of content and a destination to which you want to syndicate the content.">Syndications</a> for more
                information.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: You don't support a type of feed that I need. Is there a way for me to create a
                    custom feed?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Yes. You can create custom feeds using our Universal Syndication Template
                Language (USTL) and Universal Syndication. See <a class="xref" href="fms.html" title="The Universal Syndication Template Language (USTL) enables you to create asset templates in any format that meets your needs. For example, you can create a list of assets and their metadata in an XML, JSON, CSV, or any other text format.">Universal Syndication Template
