    <div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">Have questions? Take a look at what other Ooyala customers are asking
                about.</p>

            <div class="section">
                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Can I add Facebook integration to an existing Ooyala Live
                                channel?</strong></p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Facebook integration can be added to all channels created after
                                Live release 1.4.0.</p>

                        <p class="p"/>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: I may <em class="ph i">sometimes</em>, but not <em class="ph i">always</em>, want to stream to a
                                        Facebook page. Am I required to provide Facebook
                                        authentication each time I start the channel? Will I be able
                                        to stream to a Facebook page if I do not provide Facebook
                                        authentication?</strong></p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> When Ooyala Live starts a channel, it checks if it has the access
                                token for the Facebook account associated with the channel. If not,
                                Ooyala Live will prompt the user to sign in. Note that Ooyala Live
                                does not store any Facebook account credentials.</p>

                        <p class="p"/>

                        
                        
                        
                        
                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What happens with the syndications rules assigned to Backlot while
                                        using the playlist? Are these overridden?</strong></p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Nothing changes with the syndication rules. </p>

                    <p class="p"/>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How does the transcoding on the fly for this playlist works? is it using the source file?</strong></p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Simulated Live is supported where the source is HLS. So as long as
                                the rendition has HLS, that will be the ingest for the Elemental
                                Live encoder. </p>

                    <p class="p"/>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Are the analytics gathered reflected in the playlist embed code or in
                                        the asset?</strong></p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Today the analytics is reflected in the playlist embed code. We
                                have plans to add asset embed code support in Q1, 2017. </p>

                    <p class="p"/>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Does the Server side Ad insertion work for this feature?</strong></p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Yes, it does. Simulated Live is only available for Elemental
                                servers, and it supports SSAI. </p>

                    <p class="p"/>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Does Facebook syndication work for Simulated Live?</strong></p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Yes, it does. Simulated Live is only available for Elemental
                                servers, as is Facebook Live syndication. </p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Is there a slate for playlists?</strong></p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> There is a slate and it will only apply if the playlist is empty. </p>

                    <p class="p"/>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: If elemental is using m3u8, what happens to the assets that do not have
                                        an HLS stream?</strong></p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> If the asset does not have an HLS stream URL, you will not be able
                                to add it to the playlist. </p>

                    <p class="p"/>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: If elemental is using m3u8, does reprocessing occur on the fly or is
                                        only using the chunks? If the reprocessing is on the fly,
                                        does this means Elemental uses the highest bitrate that is
                                        found? What happens with assets that don't have the same
                                        bitrates?</strong></p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Elemental is reprocessing on the fly, the source is m3u8, and it
                                uses the highest bitrate of the source. The output is always the
                                same bitrate. If the source and the highest bitrate are different,
                                you will probably see a change in quality in the output. </p>

                    <p class="p"/>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Is the file input loop for slates configurable to true or
                                false?</strong></p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> The loop is always set to true and cannot be configured. </p>

                    <p class="p"/>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How accurate is trimming with Live to VOD?</strong></p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Trimming is accurate to within the segment size. </p>

                    <p class="p"/>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How long after an event that is set to archive does the trimming automatically occur?</strong></p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Automatic trimming occurs one hour after the event plus the
                                duration of the event.</p>

                    <p class="p"/>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What is the maximum time permitted for Live to VOD?</strong></p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> 8 hours for Ooyala package, 24 hours for Azure. Live to VOD is not
                                supported for Akamai. </p>
