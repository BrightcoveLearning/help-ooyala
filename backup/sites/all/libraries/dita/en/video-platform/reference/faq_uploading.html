            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: I've uploaded the video but it does not show in Backlot. What should I
                do?</strong></p>

            <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Make sure you have uploaded any associated manifest files along with your
                videos (see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/ingestion_fileformats.html">Manifest File Formats</a> for
                details). After upload, there should be no delay in a file appearing in Backlot's
                MANAGE page. If the file doesn't appear, something might have gone wrong: <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">(OIS v1 only): If you use FTP or Aspera, check your logs for errors. See
                            <a class="xref" href="../concepts/ingestion_log.html">Ingestion Log
                            and Error Messages</a> for more information.</li>

                    <li class="li">You should attempt to upload the file again.</li>

                    <li class="li">You should also check the validity of your metadata file to ensure that it
                        is correctly tagged.</li>

                </ul>
 If the problem persists, contact Technical Support.</div>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Do you store my videos if they do not go through into Backlot?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> No, if a problem prevents a file from being saved to the Backlot database,
                the file might have been deleted. Attempt to upload the file again.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">UTF-8 Characters</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Why am I getting "Internal Server Error" in the Details tab of my FTP + CSV
                    ingested content?</strong></p>

            <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong>Backlot accepts only UTF-8 characters. When ingesting via FTP + CSV, you
                might have included non UTF-8 characters that, although similar to UTF-8 characters,
                are not valid UTF-8. For example, there are many characters that look like quotation
                marks. The following are used most frequently: <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">" U+0022 QUOTATION MARK</li>

                    <li class="li">“ U+201C LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK</li>

                    <li class="li">” U+201D RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK</li>

                </ul>
U+0022 is valid UTF-8. If you specify either of the other two, Backlot will
                return an error. Therefore, remember to verify that all of your CSV characters are
                valid UTF-8. </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Uploading Logs and Records</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Where can I see all the videos that I uploaded during this month?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> By default, in Backlot's MANAGE page, files are listed by most recent
                creation date. (You can reverse the sort order.) Thus, files uploaded in any
                particular month are always grouped together.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: In Backlot, can I see just those videos that have not finished
                uploading?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Yes, you can. See the topic in <a class="xref" href="../tasks/video_manage_details.html" title="The Details enables you to configure metadata and specify a player.">Managing Video
                    Details</a>. Set the status to <strong class="ph b">Processing</strong> to see videos still being
                transcoded. </p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Are there any logs of my FTP activity?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Your own FTP client software might keep a record of all of your FTP
                sessions in log files or elsewhere on your own computer. Become familiar with where
                this information is stored on your system so that you an examine these logs for
                possible problems. If you are uploading over an extended period, you might consider
                retaining these logs for future reference, keeping them from being archived or
                overwritten, in case of a possible future need to debug any issues that might arise.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Limits</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How many GB can I upload at a time?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> A per-customer quota of 100GB applies. When using FTP or Aspera to upload
                content, the maximum amount of data that should be in the upload process at any
                given time is 100 GB. To avoid exceeding this quota, keep track of how much data you
                upload at a time, and wait for files to be fully ingested and processed before
                starting additional upload operations. Once a file has finished uploading, it is no
                longer counted against the quota. </p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What's the API upload limit?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>None. There is no quota (as there is with FTP and Aspera). However, Ooyala
                highly recommends that you chunk your files into smaller portions (as detailed in
                    <a class="xref" href="../tasks/api_asset_upload.html" title="Only certain assets require uploading: video and audio files.">Uploading a Video or
                    Audio Asset</a>) to prevent problems that can occur in transferring a large
                file over any network.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Uploader V2</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What do I need to change to support HTTPS uploads?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> First, contact Brightcove Technical Support to enable HTTPS uploading for your
                account. Next, you need to change your programs to use <samp class="ph codeph">https://</samp> on
                the PUT upload requests, instead of <samp class="ph codeph">http://</samp>.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Encoding and Processing Profiles</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What is encoding?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The process of converting a video stream into several formats optimized for
                various playback devices. The set of values used to create the optimized formats is
                the video's encode.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What is a processing profile?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>A processing profile is a set of encodes you can use as a template when
                encoding your videos. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/encodings_recommendations_ratios.html">Encoding Recommendations for Player V4</a></p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Browser Capabilities</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Which is the best browser to use when uploading via Backlot UI?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Google Chrome, latest version.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What are the limitations of Google Chrome, if any?</strong></p>

            <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Chrome has an internal "sandbox" that allows uploading multiple file chunks
                in parallel. When one of the chunks has a problem, Chrome attempts to re-upload the
                problem chunk, not all chunks. However, this internal sandbox can become full and
                need to be cleared. If you are having many upload failures, use the steps below to
                clear the browser cache and clean up the browser's sandbox: <ol class="ol">
                    <li class="li">Clear the browser cache by following the instructions at <a class="xref" href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/95582?hl=en" target="_blank">https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/95582?hl=en</a>.</li>

                    <li class="li">Bring up Chrome's console by following the instructions at <a class="xref" href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/console#opening_the_console" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/console#opening_the_console</a></li>

                    <li class="li">In the console window, type the following and hit enter:
                        <pre class="pre codeblock">windows.localStorage.clear()</pre>
</li>

                </ol>
</div>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What are the limitations of Firefox, if any?</strong></p>

            <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Although Backlot runs over the HTTPS (secure) protocol, the file chunks
                themselves are uploaded over the HTTP protocol. With Firefox v22 and later, the
                browser does not allow running HTTP from an HTTPS page (so-called "mixed content").
                Thus Firefox's default setting prevents file uploading to backlot. You need to
                configure your browser to allow "mixed content", as described below: <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This
                    configuration allows mixed content from <em class="ph i">any</em> site, not just
                    Backlot.</div>
<ol class="ol">
                    <li class="li">In the Firefox location bar, type the following and hit enter:
                            <samp class="ph codeph">about:config</samp></li>

                    <li class="li">Scroll down to find the following key:

                    <li class="li">Right-click the word <samp class="ph codeph">true</samp>.</li>

</div>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What are the limitations of Safari, if any?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> None that Ooyala knows of at this time.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What are the limitations of Internet Explorer, if any?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Always use the latest version of Internet Explorer. You must also use the
                Google Chrome Frame extension, which is being discontinued by Google. Ooyala
                recommends Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari over Internet Explorer for uploading. </p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What are the ideal network settings for Backlot UI uploads?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> The fastest, highest bandwidth connections from your machines to <a class="xref" href="https://backlot.ooyala.com" target="_blank">https://backlot.ooyala.com</a> are the most desirable. In addition, the
                ideal is that your browser connects directly to the Ooyala servers without going
                through any proxy servers. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Content Migration</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Who is this service for?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> If you have an extensive video library, and require assistance in moving
                your content to Ooyala, you will benefit most from Ooyala’s Content Migration
                Services. When self-migration (i.e. via Backlot Web upload, FTP, Aspera, APIs) is
                not an option, a Professional Services-assisted migration makes sense.</p>

            <div class="p">Some of the most common benefits of managed services include <ul class="ul">
