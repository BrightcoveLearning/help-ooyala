    <div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">Frequently asked questions about Ooyala IQ analytics.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">General</h2><strong class="ph b">Q: What is Ooyala IQ?</strong>
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Ooyala IQ is Ooyala’s new video analytics product built on top of our
                reliable, robust, and scalable big data architecture, providing real-time analytics
                as well as multi-dimensional analytics capabilities to provide a full 360 degree
                view of video consumption and engagement patterns. It is a major upgrade to the
                existing Ooyala Analytics product and will be available for all Ooyala customers at
                no additional cost. </p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How is it different from your previous Analytics product?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>A key difference is that Ooyala IQ enables multi-dimensional analysis with
                no pre-configuration of reports needed. You can now see more than one set of data at
                a time. For example, the Content Programming team can now see data filtered by Label
                and by Device Type at the same time to understand the consumption patterns in a
                group of videos (e.g. sports content) consumed on mobile devices versus desktop. In
                our previous industry-leading analytics product, you could only investigate one set
                of data at a time.</p>

            <p class="p">This powerful functionality is reflected in the new v3 Analytics API and the Business
                Intelligence page in Ooyala IQ UI. The Business Intelligence page gives you one
                consolidated console with metrics for asset or label, device (platform and OS and
                browser), geo (country, region, state/province, DMA), player, and traffic source,
                centralizing the investigation of all aspects of your video consumption on a single
                page, and allowing you to drill down into more details as necessary. For details on
                the product differences, please see the chart below.</p>

            </div>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What are the new features that I should care about and why?</strong></p>

            <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The following capabilities are new: <ol class="ol">
                    <li class="li">Newly designed user interface built on HTML:<p class="p">The new HTML UI removes the
                            reliance on a Flash plugin, provides the ability to access IQ on various
                            devices (e.g. iPad), and offers performance improvements.</p>
</li>

                    <li class="li">New multi-dimensional analytics capability: <p class="p">With Ooyala’s new
                            multi-dimensional querying capability, you can now run analytics across
                            multiple dimensions, including Device Type (e.g. Mobile, Tablet,
                            Desktop, Set-top Box, etc.) or OS/Browser, Geography (Country, Region,
                            State/Province, DMA), Domain, Player, Asset or Label. This will help
                            address your more complex business questions such as “How many unique
                            viewers from the United States and Canada do I have for a subset of
                            videos consumed on Tablet - iOS during the last month”?</p>

                    </li>

                    <li class="li">New Video Details page: <p class="p">The new Video Details page will give you a
                            holistic, detailed view into the performance of an asset. Apart from
                            uniques and engagement data, you’ll now be able to view key asset
                            metadata, key performance metrics for the asset, and asset consumption
                            broken down by each dimension. You can access the Video Details page
                            directly from either the Dashboard or the Business Intelligence page
                            simply by clicking on the asset. This increased accessibility, along
                            with detailed performance of a specific asset, allows you to quickly
                            identify consumption and engagement patterns for that asset.</p>
</li>

                    <li class="li">Real-time statistics for top 100 videos: <p class="p">The new real-time Dashboard in
                            Ooyala IQ will show you the top 100 videos and their viewership data in
                            real time, while the old analytics product only showed the top three videos. </p>
</li>

                    <li class="li">Improved reporting: <ul class="ul">
                            <li class="li">Metrics are more accurately defined and calculated; </li>

                            <li class="li">Geography and device reporting are provided via more accurate
                                technologies;</li>

                            <li class="li">Algorithms for counting unique users are improved and reporting of
                                unique users now span a longer date range;</li>

                            <li class="li">Built on more robust, scalable and performant big data architecture.

</div>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What are the new metrics and dimensions in Ooyala IQ?</strong></p>

            <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The following new metrics and dimensions have been added. <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Video Starts.</strong> “Video Starts” indicate when the actual video content
                        starts playing. If pre-roll ads are played, a “video start” would only be
                        counted when all pre-roll ads are completed and the actual video content
                        starts playing. By comparing Plays Requested (referred to as Plays in the
                        old v2 analytics) and Video Starts, you will be able to see the viewer
                        drop-off due to pre-roll ads.</li>

                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Player Dimension.</strong> The Player dimension can be used in multiple ways.
                        Players can be used to report: <ol class="ol">
                            <li class="li">the playback metrics for syndication partners (by creating a player
                                for each syndication partner you wish to track)</li>

                            <li class="li">performance within different sections of your website (by creating a
                                player for each section)</li>

                            <li class="li">performance due to a change in the player (by creating players with
                                and without the player configuration such as different ad load,
                                enablement of the Discovery content recommendation tool, or simply a
                                change to the player UI)</li>

                    number of plays and displays in Ooyala Analytics. Why is this happening?
                </strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The statistics from Google or your ad provider have no direct
                relation to the statistics provided by Ooyala; you cannot make a direct comparison
                among them because every system calculates statistics in a unique way, due to
                variations in underlying data and lack of industry-wide standards for these
                calculations and data points. This is like comparing the proverbial apples to the
                proverbial oranges. For explanations of their statistics, you need to contact your
                ad providers directly. In addition, errors in implementation, such as specifying
                Google analytics tags twice in your web pages, can cause apparent discrepancies with
                Ooyala’s data. As a courtesy to our customers, Ooyala displays some ad providers’
                statistics directly in Backlot; however, the statistics are calculated by the ad
                provider, not by Ooyala. </p>

<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Is analytics data
                    available for closed caption usage?</strong></p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Using Ooyala IQ with Third Party (non-Ooyala) Players</h2>
            
            <strong class="ph b">Q: Can I use Ooyala IQ with any third party player? Are there any limitations on what
                players I can integrate with?</strong>
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>With this release, IQ has the capability to receive analytics from any
                streaming device and any player. You can integrate Ooyala IQ with third-party
                players for web-based platforms and OSs supporting JavaScript using the <a class="xref" href="../tasks/analytics_v3_integrate_javascriptsdk.html">Ooyala IQ
                    JavaScript SDK</a>. You can also integrate with devices that do not support
                JavaScript using the <a class="xref" href="../tasks/analytics_v3_json_api.html">Ooyala IQ JSON API</a>. Integrate Ooyala IQ with Roku devices with the <a class="xref" href="../concepts/analytics_v3_roku_sdk.html">Ooyala IQ Roku
                    SDK</a>.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What third-party player platforms does Ooyala IQ support currently with
                    out-of-the-box integrations? </strong></p>

            <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Ooyala IQ currently supports out-of-the-box integrations (adapters and
                SDKs) for the following platforms and third-party players: <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">Roku (OSv7+)</li>

                    <li class="li">Xbox One</li>

                    <li class="li">Brightcove player</li>

                    <li class="li">FlowPlayer player</li>

                    <li class="li">HTML5 video tag player</li>

                    <li class="li">JW Player</li>

                    <li class="li">Kaltura player</li>

                    <li class="li">YouTube player</li>

                </ul>
 An out-of-the-box integration for AppleTV is coming soon. If you use Ooyala's
                upcoming tvOS SDK, Ooyala IQ will support AppleTV analytics out-of-the-box. If you
                don't use the upcoming Ooyala tvOS SDK, (for example, apps being developed for
                AppleTV using their native tvOS, not Ooyala's), you will need to connect with the
                Ooyala IQ Javascript JSDK. Ooyala PSG can perform this integration for a fee. </div>

            <p class="p">You can still integrate Ooyala IQ with any device or player (like FireTV, Sony
                Playstation, and other streaming devices) by integrating with the Ooyala IQ JSON API
                or JavaScript SDK for JavaScript-enabled platforms. </p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Can I use the Ooyala player and third party players in the same provider
                    account?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>For Ooyala assets, you can now use one Backlot account to view metrics for
                Ooyala and third-party players. You can use one Backlot account and see consolidated
                mixed player analytics in one IQ dashboard. For third-party assets, you will need a
                separate provider account.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Can I have a sub-account for my different third-party players where the IQ data
                    in the master account would be an aggregate of both?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Yes. If you have one Backlot account to host assets (or assets' metadata
                only) for your Roku player and another Backlot account to host assets (or assets'
                metadata only) for your JW Player, you can have two sub-accounts with one master
                account to control them.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How does the value for Unique Users get calculated?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong> If you are already using Ooyala as your OVP for some properties, we use
                the equivalent of a Device ID or sub-account properties (which may be using a third
                party OVP). If the user was anonymous (not logged in) we use a tracking ID assigned
                to a user. It is not recommended to use a user UUID that represents a logged-in
                user.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Can I use Discovery with my non-Ooyala player?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>No. Discovery currently does not support players other than Ooyala. This
                applies to both the in-player Discovery experience and the Discovery APIs. If you
                manage multiple sites/properties, and use the Ooyala player for one or more of those
                sites, Discovery is available for them alone.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: For the "Player" Dimension in the BI page of the IQ UI, what will render in the
                    "Player" dimension my accounts? </strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>You will see the player name as the Player dimension (for example, JW
                Player).</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: On the Asset Details page there is an area where you can play an asset and see
                    the segments watched graph progress in real time. Will I be able to capture that
                    data with a third-party (non-Ooyala) player? </strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>On the Asset Details page, we only load an Ooyala player. We will not
                render a third-party player in that page. However, we do support using the Ooyala
                player to play the video assets as long as you ingest the asset URL, similar to how
                we can use the Ooyala player to play a remote asset. You will see the segments
                watched bar progress in real time. If you don’t ingest the asset URL, we cannot play
                it.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">What do I have to host and what does Ooyala host?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>For the JavaScript SDK and adapters for JavaScript-enabled players, Ooyala
                hosts the JavaScript libraries. For the Ooyala IQ SDK for
                Roku and SDK for Xbox, Ooyala hosts the Ooyala IQ SDKs for
                Roku and Xbox on GitHub (where you can download the library). The Ooyala IQ
                SDK for Roku and SDK for Xbox must be an integral part of your Roku channel
                package and Xbox app package, because it cannot be downloaded to a Roku box
                or Xbox on the fly as you can with the JavaScript SDK on web pages.
                    </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What happens when my non-Ooyala player is updated? Will I need to
                    make changes to how the IQ SDK is implemented?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>If your player is updated or changed, you will need to test and verify the
                SDK integration to ensure nothing is broken.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Ooyala IQ JSON API</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What are the major advantages to use JSON data format in IQ data ingestion
                    API?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>JSON is an open-standard data format that is language independent making it
                easy to read and write. It enables IQ to “receive” player events and data from any
                device/player. In addition, JSON’s attribute-value pairs can be easily expanded to

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>No, anyone can use this API (existing Ooyala CMS customers, new Ooyala CMS
                customers, standalone customers, and so on).</p>

                    information? If this is set, does this overwrite Ooyala's standard geo
                    reporting?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Yes and yes. Ooyala uses Quova to derive geo information from ip addresses,

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What is the difference between the IQ JavaScript SDK and the player-specific
                    adapter?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The IQ JavaScript SDK is an SDK that interacts with the backend of Ooyala
                IQ. The player-specific adapter is an adapter that bridges a third-party player with
                the IQ JavaScript SDK.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Will the Ooyala-built adapters for standard third-party players
                    (JavaScript-based) support changes in the Player APIs and version upgrades in an
                    on-going fashion?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Yes, Ooyala will support player API updates and the adapters will be
                revised to support the changes to the standard third-party players.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What do I need to know about the third-party player to write an adapter for
                    it?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>To write an adapter for a third-party player you need to understand the
                third-party player's event APIs or eventing mechanism. This will help you map the
                player's events to the Ooyala IQ JavaScript SDK or JSON SDK. </p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: The Ooyala IQ JavaScript SDK documentation says that I should call the method
                    reportPlayRequested when the playback of the video has been requested. Do I need
                    to distinguish between play and resume?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Yes, you need to distinguish between these two cases. A play is when the
                user clicks the play button for the first time on the player and a resume should be
                counted when the user clicks play after the video has been in the paused state.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What should I do if I have a playlist with multiple videos in it that get
                    played on the same player? Do the events get re-counted?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>You should call the method initualizeMedia for each video that gets played
                on the player. This will ensure that events are counted for each video. Even though
                the same player is used to play multiple videos, each video should go through the
                same event lifecycle and have all of the event methods called (initializeMedia,
                setMediaDuration, reportPlayRequested, etc.). </p>

                    SDK?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>You should call reportPlayHeadUpdate frequently (every 2-3 seconds).</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What is the flow if the user changes to a different video with the next button?
                    If I'm using the Ooyala IQ JavaScript SDK, should I call reportComplete in this
                    use case where the media did not finish?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>No. If the media did not finish, do not call reportComplete. You should
                call initializeMedia for the new video and call the rest of the event methods for
                the new video (initializeMedia, setMediaDuration, reportPlayRequested, etc.).</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How should I test my third-party player adapter?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Contact your Ooyala representative to engage your CSM or technical support
                to test your adapter.</p>

                    single specific day as the date range, but the Video Starts number does not
                    match the starting number in the segments watched graph. Why is this
                    happening?</strong></p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>We divide each video into 40 segments no matter how long the video is.
                When the user watches the first segment, we increase the count for the first segment
                as "watched". This means that there could be a case where your count for video
                starts is higher than the number of viewers who watched the entirety of the first
                segment. Some users may drop off before the first 1/40th of the video completes.</p>


                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How often do the metrics on the Business Intelligence page get updated?</strong></p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>A user action will trigger the page to get updated. If you don’t take
                another action, the page usually will not get updated because no new information
                needs to be updated. It is a historical view. The only exception is when you choose
                time range to include “Today”. Then the data will be different after around 4 hours
                since we are continuously processing the data coming in today.</p>

            <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Unique Viewership</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What is a specific example of what would count as a “unique” play?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>According to our definition that can be found in <a class="xref" href="glossary.html">Glossary</a>, a unique play is
                “the number of unique viewers for which a video, channel, or channel set is
                displayed in a given period.” Thus, if a viewer watches a video and then later
                watches the same video again, that counts as two plays but a single unique play.
                Unique viewers, more often referred to as "unique users", are defined based on the
                environment. The Ooyala mobile SDKs generates and stores a random unique ID which is
                application-specific. In other environments, a unique user is identified by local
                storage or cookie. If a user clears their browser cache, that user/device's ID will
                get regenerated next time they watch video. The generated IDs are completely random
                and don't include any user-identifiable information. When such information is not
                available for a user, a new unique identifier will be created for that
                user.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How are unique users calculated on iOS, Android, and desktop platforms?</strong></p>

            <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong>
                <ul class="ul">
    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b"><span class="ph">Ooyala</span> mobile SDK for iOS:</strong> The <span class="ph">Ooyala</span>
     mobile SDK for iOS generates and stores a random unique ID which is application-specific. The
     unique ID is generated in the <span class="ph">"OOClientID"</span> class and is stored in the
      <span class="ph">"standardUserDefaults"</span> object and is valid until the application is
     deleted. This unique ID cannot be erased or reset by the end user without deleting the app. The
     application developer can store a different ID than the generated ID by erasing the existing ID
      <span class="ph">[OOClientID resetID]</span> and setting a new ID <span class="ph">[OOClientID setID:New_ID]</span>. </li>

    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b"><span class="ph">Ooyala</span> mobile SDK for Android:</strong> The <span class="ph">Ooyala</span> mobile SDK for Android generates and store a random unique ID which is
     application-specific. The unique ID is generated in the <span class="ph">"OOClientID"</span>
     class and is stored in the <span class="ph">"SharedPreferences"</span> file and is valid until
     the application is deleted. This unique ID cannot be erased or reset by the end user without
     deleting the app. The application developer can store a different ID by erasing the existing ID
      <span class="ph">[ClientID.resetID(context)]</span> and setting a new ID <span class="ph">[ClientID.resetID(NEW_ID)]</span>.</li>

    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">All other environments (HTML5, Flash, Chromecast): </strong>In other environments, a unique
     user is identified by local storage or cookies. To generate the <span class="ph">GUID</span>,
     Flash players use the timestamp of when the <span class="ph">GUID</span> is generated and
     append random data to it. The string is then converted to <span class="ph">base64</span>. To
     generate the <span class="ph">GUID</span>, HTML5 players use the current time, browser
     information, and random data and hash it and convert it to <span class="ph">base64</span>.
     Within the same browser on desktop, once a <span class="ph">GUID</span> is set by one platform
     it is used for both platforms for the user. If a user clears their browser cache, that
     user/device's ID will get regenerated next time they watch video. Incognito modes will track a
     user for a single session, but once the browser is closed the <span class="ph">GUID</span> is
     erased. </li>
