            <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> This topic contains older information and has been deprecated. For the
        latest information about Ooyala integration with Chromecast, see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/chromecast/index.html">Chromecast Integration</a>.</div>

            <p class="p">The sample receiver and sender applications use Google's <a class="xref" href="https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/reference/chrome/chrome.cast.media" target="_blank"> media namespace</a> to send play, pause,
                seek, start, and other events between the sender and receiver. We use Google's cast
                media commands, which create media status objects in the receiver code. The receiver
                publishes to the Ooyala message bus to set closed captions and send additional
                player state information to the sender. You can use your own sender application with
                the Ooyala receiver application as long as you set up the communication protocol to
                handle events.</p>

            <p class="p">The namespace used in the sender and receiver Ooyala Chromecast Integration
                applications is x-urn:cast:ooyala.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Sender → Receiver</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Upon connecting to the receiver, the sender creates a media session that loads the required video via the MediaInfo object with the video embed code. When the video is loaded, the sender gets a media object from the receiver which is used to communicate with the receiver. The sender also gets messages through the Ooyala namespace message bus from the receiver to control closed captions and update the state of its control widgets.</p>

            <p class="p">The sender receives media status updates implicitly to know whether or not the media session is alive, the state of the player, etc. Sender commands to control the player have callbacks that can be used for notifications about changes in media status.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Receiver → Sender</h2>
            
            <p class="p">All events are processed through the <a class="xref" href="https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/reference/receiver/cast.receiver.MediaManager" target="_blank">MediaManager object</a>. When you call
                commands on the receiver, methods on MediaManager are called, such as
                MediaManager.onPlay, MediaManager.onSeek, etc. Look at the comments in <a class="xref" href="https://github.com/ooyala/chromecast-sample-receiver/blob/master/receiver_custom.html" target="_blank">https://github.com/ooyala/chromecast-sample-receiver/blob/master/receiver_custom.html</a>
                for a detailed breakdown of events communicated with the MediaManager object.</p>
