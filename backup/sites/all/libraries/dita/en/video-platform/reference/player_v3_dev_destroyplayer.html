      <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Ooyala Player V3 is deprecated and is scheduled
    to be <em class="ph i">disabled</em> on 2018-01-31. After that date, Player V3 will no longer play your video
    or audio content. Customers still using Player V3 need to migrate to Player V4 (see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/pbv4_migration_v3.html">Migrating from Player V3</a> and <a class="xref" href="../concepts/pbv4_migration_faq.html">Player Migration FAQ</a>).</div>

      In this example, you will learn how to use the
        <samp class="ph codeph">onCreate()</samp> function to handle events related to the playing of a video. In
      this advanced application, the user plays a video, and the event handlers determine when the
      video has finished playing. At that point, the event handler destroys the player and displays
      a message to the user. <div class="p">The purpose of this web page is to monitor and respond to
        downloading, playhead time changes, and played events, so the design will include: <ul class="ul" id="player_v3_dev_destroyplayer__ul_omg_t13_pr">

  <div class="section" id="player_v3_dev_destroyplayer__section_fjw_qt5_qr"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 1: Listening to Multiple Events</h2>
      
      <div class="p">Sometimes it is useful to listen and respond to multiple events at once. One way to do this
        is to subscribe to all events. The <a class="xref" href="../concepts/player_v3_dev_eventmodel.html#player_v3_dev__eventmodel" title="The HTML5 Player V3 incorporates the use of a message bus to handle events.">Event Model for HTML5 Player V3 (Deprecated)</a> provides you
        with a message bus, accessed via the created Player object's <span class="keyword apiname">mb</span> object.
        In this case we will use the message bus <span class="keyword apiname">subscribe()</span> function specifying
        a wildcard (<samp class="ph codeph">"*"</samp>) for the event
        name:<pre class="pre codeblock">          function onCreate(player) {
          
            /* Subscribe to all events: 
             * this allows you to create logic based on multiple events. */
            player.mb.subscribe("*" , 'example', function(eventName) { 
            
            });
          }</pre>
</div>

      <div class="p">Now that we are listening for every possible event, we can include logic based on multiple
        events within the callback function via its <span class="keyword parmname">eventName</span> parameter. In
        this example we write all events, except for downloading and playhead time changed events
          (<span class="keyword apiname">OO.EVENTS.DOWNLOADING</span> and
          <span class="keyword apiname">OO.EVENTS.PLAYHEAD_TIME_CHANGED</span> ), to the JavaScript console
        log:<pre class="pre codeblock">          function onCreate(player) {
          
           /*
            * Subscribe to all events:
            * this allows you to create logic 
            * based on multiple events.
            */
            player.mb.subscribe("*" , 'example', function(eventName) { 
            
              /* Write all events, except for downloading and playhead time changed events,

      <div class="p">Once the video has finished playing, we would like to properly destroy the player and
