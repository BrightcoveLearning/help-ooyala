            <p class="p">The performance of websites and web applications is a complicated subject. There isn’t a single set of recommendations that will work in all cases. When optimizing performance, it is worth considering that all websites are different and that most optimizations come with tradeoffs. With that in mind it is recommended to tailor your performance strategy to the specific needs of your website.</p>
  
            <p class="p">When it comes to video and web pages, there are often tradeoffs. Faster overall page
                load can mean slower video startup within the page. Utilities like Google’s
                PageSpeed Insights promotes giving full control to the browser to make decisions.
                However, in our testing, we found that this approach often results in slower video
                performance. As a result, web developers will need to make decisions on which to
                optimize; page load vs. video startup speed. For more insights on this subject,
                please see <a class="xref" href="https://www.ooyala.com/resources/videomind-blog/how-increasing-your-google-pagespeed-score-could-mean-worse-video" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
