            <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Ooyala Player V3 is deprecated and is scheduled
    to be <em class="ph i">disabled</em> on 2018-01-31. After that date, Player V3 will no longer play your video
    or audio content. Customers still using Player V3 need to migrate to Player V4 (see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/pbv4_migration_v3.html">Migrating from Player V3</a> and <a class="xref" href="../concepts/pbv4_migration_faq.html">Player Migration FAQ</a>).</div>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>See <a class="xref" href="../concepts/player_flash.html" title="Flash Player V3 documentation.">Flash Player V3 (Deprecated)</a>.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What is the HTML5 Player?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>See <a class="xref" href="../concepts/player_html5.html" title="HTML5 Player V3 documentation.">HTML5 Player V3 (Deprecated)</a>.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Can I use the HTML5 player exclusively across all devices?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>You can use HTML5 across all Ooyala supported devices. However, your
                decision to use a particular player exclusively or not depends upon the types of
                viewing experiences that you want your viewers to have. While Flash is not supported
                across all devices it does offer some advantages over HTML5. Ooyala’s Player V3
                gives you flexibility in deciding what viewing experience you want for your
                customers. For details, see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/player_compare.html" title="Helps you decide which Player V3 to implement: the HTML5 Player or Flash Player.">Player V3 - Comparison Between HTML5 and Flash Players (Deprecated)</a>.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: When I'm in iOS, am I using the HTML5 Player?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>When you are using iOS, you are using the HTML5 player. iOS devices do not
                support Adobe Flash. The variations in support are as follows:</p>

            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">If you are using an Apple Mac Desktop running a supported browser, you are using
                    the HTML5 player.</li>

                <li class="li">When using a mobile device running the Ooyala player in a supported web browser,
                    you are using the HTML5 player.</li>

                <li class="li">Ooyala also offers our Mobile iOS SDK. This SDK lets you create custom video
                    apps that run HTML5 players.</li>

            </ul>

            <div class="p">For more information about HTML5 support for Ooyala players on Apple iOS desktops and
                devices, see: <ul class="ul">

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Is HTML5 secure?</strong></p>

            <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>HTML5 in and of itself is not secure. You need to research the possible
                security limitations in HTML5. However, if you are interested in securing your video
                content, Ooyala provides a number of content protection mechanisms for your assets.
                These include everything from token authorization to our Rights Locker API. Ooyala
                provides, in increasing levels of protection, the following options for protecting
                your content: <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">Protected streams</li>

                    <li class="li">Playback authorization, including token-based authentication</li>

                    <li class="li">Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems</li>

                </ul>
</div>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Why doesn't the HTML5 player work in Firefox?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Firefox does not support h264 encodings for the HTML5 Player. For more

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: I'm seeing a gray screen and no audio on iOS. What's happening?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>There is a range of possibilities that might cause this issue including
                bandwidth issues, defaulting to audio only mode, transcoding, and other issues. For
                example, assets can show a gray screen because they are missing the reference frame
                at the beginning of the video; assets that are currently showing this behavior would
                need to be re-exported and uploaded. In this case, we recommend following our best
                encoding practices whenever you are exporting your videos to upload. You can watch
                our tutorials on best encoding practices in the <span class="ph">Ooyala <a class="xref" href="http://help-ooyala.brightcove.com/video-tutorials" target="_blank">Video Tutorials</a></span>.</p>
            
            <p class="p">The player is designed to provide you the best playback experience possible based on
                your available bandwidth, CPU, Android version, and device. You need to make sure
                your iOS device is supported by Ooyala. For more information about supported

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>As with iOS, there is a range of possibilities that might cause this issue
                including bandwidth issues, defaulting to audio only mode, transcoding and others.
                For example, assets can show a gray screen because they are missing the reference

                    on the player. What should I do? </strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>For HTML5, gibberish characters can appear on the player if your browser is
                not set to Unicode encoding (UTF-8). You can set your browser encoding from your
                browser's preferences. For example, in Chrome, select <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">View</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol">Encoding</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol">Unicode (UTF-8)</span></span>. </p>

                    should I do?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The screen freezing in fullscreen mode in Flash is a known Adobe issue that
                is related to graphics acceleration. There is no official fix for this issue. If you
                want a local fix (not guaranteed to work), you can disable hardware acceleration in
                Flash and also in your graphics card. For Firefox, <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">right click on the player</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol">Settings</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol">Display</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol">Uncheck "Enable hardware acceleration"</span></span>. </p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What should I do if I'm in Android and it tells me to install Flash?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Some Android devices, when communicating through the browser, provide
                identifying information that servers interpret as being from desktop computers. As a
                result, based on the Player settings you have chosen, Ooyala may attempt to deliver
                Flash. If you, the Android device owner, get the message to install Flash, you need
                to change your Player settings. Once the settings are changed, the device owner
                should get HTML5 video.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What does Content Unavailable mean? How should I resolve it?</strong></p>

            <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>You have a range of possibilities as a source for this error. Essentially,
                it means content is not getting to the player. Some of the possible sources for this
                error are: <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">You could have deleted the content.</li>

                    <li class="li">Your content is blocked because of a bug.</li>

                    <li class="li">Your content is blocked because authentication failed.</li>

</div>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: The player doesn't load, I'm only seeing a black box. What now?</strong></p>

            <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>You can do some preliminary checks to make sure it is not a problem with
                your web page, your browser, your device, or a network issue. Some initial tests
                that you can do: <ol class="ol">
                    <li class="li">Create a test page with just the player with no other apps or code or calls.
                        Check if the player is still not loading.</li>

                    <li class="li">Make sure your player is compatible with the device that you are using. For
                        example, in general iOS devices do not support Flash players. For more
                        information, see <a class="xref" href="player_requirements.html" title="Player V3 is designed to deliver the highest quality experience for live and on demand video.">Player Requirements</a>.</li>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>You can do some preliminary checks to make sure it is not a problem with
                your web page or network issue. For example, if you are a provider, you can check to
                see if custom styling was applied to the &lt;div&gt; container or the player
                that should not have been applied. Viewers need to contact their provider to resolve
                issues. If you can’t resolve the problem, you need to open a support ticket with
                Brightcove Technical Support. When opening a ticket, you need to supply information
                about how you are playing the video, including what is the device, the browser, is
                it a Flash or HTML5 player, is it an application or an app built with our Android or

            <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>You can do some preliminary checks to make sure this is not a problem with
                your web page or a network issue. Although this may not be true in all cases, this
                green pixelation has been seen with some Flash players. Some Flash versions can
                cause this behavior (e.g. Flash 10.1) or it may be a combination of Flash player
                settings and a low capacity video card. In this case, you can try upgrading to the
                latest Flash player version. If the issue continues to show, please follow these
                instructions: <ol class="ol">
                    <li class="li">Right click on the Ooyala player and go to 'settings'.</li>

                    <li class="li">Go to the 'screen' icon at your left.</li>

                    <li class="li">Uncheck the 'Enable hardware acceleration' checkbox.</li>

                limitations on pre-4.X devices. We allow Live Streaming for HTML5 on 4.X using HLS,
                but there is a significant number of devices that don't work correctly in this mode.
                Live Streaming on Android with HTML5 for Android versions earlier than 4.x is not
                supported. There are native limitations in pre-4-X devices that have an impact on

                that these platforms do not provide a fully standardized HTML5 implementation and

                If you are using our Player V3 API, with either HTML5 or Flash, you can leverage the
                message bus to set your screen. </p>

            <div class="p">You can use the WILL_CHANGE_FULLSCREEN to either discover the state of fullscreen or
                to set the fullscreen state. Using the message publish() function, you can set the

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>You have several options you can use to restrict playback time. The Player
                API provides some functions that enable you to get and set playback time. These

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>In general, you can select a playback bitrate. However, why and when you
                would do this depends upon your player. We support bitrate selection for both Flash
                and HTML5 player implementations. For our Player V3, Flash is handled as
                pass-through implementation. For some general background on how we use bitrates, see

                would to your standard HTML5 player. With the HTML5 player, the parameters are
                included in the hash of the player onCreate function. The simplest format is as
                follows: <pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;script&gt;
        var videoPlayer = OO.Player.create('playerwrapper',
        'video_embed_code', {
              // additional params go here
              });
             videoPlayer.play();
&lt;/script&gt;              </pre>
</div>

            <div class="p">The following example, taken from “Creating a Custom Module” example, shows how

            <div class="p">If instead, you want to know how to send parameters to a Flash-based OPF Module
                (typically used with our Player V2 embed style), you include the parameters with the

                any other apps or web pages that might consume your bandwidth). You can also check
                your web page to see if you have included the code to ensure player loading. When
                creating your web page to load the player, we recommend that you load the Player in
                the &lt;head&gt; so it is available when the page is loaded. For example: <pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Test Player V3 Web Page &lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;!-- Load Ooyala Player --&gt;
    &lt;!-- Put the &lt;script&gt; call in the head so the Player is there when the page loads. --&gt;
    &lt;!-- Player query string parameters are added on the line below. --&gt;
    &lt;script src='http://player.ooyala.com/v3/e18ab1da1813483499554ea2d8e67fbd'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;!-- Load additional custom modules --&gt;
    &lt;!-- script src='/mymodule.js'&gt;&lt;/script --&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;    </pre>

                There are also other possible causes for the delay in loading. If the issue is not
                with your web page or device, you may need to open a ticket to have the issue
                resolved. If you open a Support case, you must include your internet connection
                speed.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Why does my video keep buffering?</strong></p>

            <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Buffering means video bytes are not getting to the client fast enough.
                There are any number of reasons that could cause this issue. Everything from your
                application to your CDN or even power outages could cause buffering. To determine
                the cause of this issue, you need to identify all the possible points of breakdown
                which can include: <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">Your web page.</li>

                    <li class="li">Your CDN.</li>

                    <li class="li">The device that you are using for playback. </li>

                    <li class="li">Your wireless setup if you are using a mobile device.</li>

                    <li class="li">Your connection speed (for example 3g and others). You can test your
                        connection using any one of a number of Internet connection speed testing
                        sites.</li>

                    <li class="li">Lowest bit-rate encoding available for playback.</li>
