                <span class="ph">Ooyala</span> player for HTML5 and Flash will start providing QoS data to <span class="ph">YOUBORA</span>. There is
                no additional integration effort required for HTML5 and Flash. For the iOS and
                Android implementations there is a small amount of code that needs to be added to
                each application. This code, along with examples and implementation steps, is
