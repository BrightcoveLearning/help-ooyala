    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Chromecast Device Registration and Concurrent Stream Limit</h1>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> This topic contains older information and has been deprecated. For the
        latest information about Ooyala integration with Chromecast, see <a class="xref" href="chromecast/index.html">Chromecast Integration</a>.</div>

        <p class="p">The sender application and receiver application are different devices. If you play
            content on both the sender and receiver devices, the mobile device and Chromecast will
            both be registered as devices. This typically happens on a '<a class="xref" href="chromecast_cast_and_play.html">play and cast</a>'
            scenario. If the user does a '<a class="xref" href="chromecast_cast_and_play.html">cast and play</a>', which means playback only happens on the
            Chromecast receiver, then only Chromecast gets registered as a device.</p>

        <p class="p">However, for concurrent stream limits, play from a sender and a receiver application is
            counted as a single concurrent stream. An example of this is if the user does the 'play
            and cast' scenario from their mobile device, where they play the content on their mobile
            device, use their mobile device to cast the content to a receiver application, and then
            continue to watch the content on the receiver. This is counted as one concurrent stream.
            The same count happens on a 'play and cast' scenario (one concurrent stream counted for
            play from a sender and a receiver). </p>
