  <div class="p">As recorded for Ooyala Analytics, the Ooyala Player categorizes video play events by three
   sub-events: displays, plays, and play starts. These data are gathered from discrete events in the
   Ooyala Player, as described below. In the Analytics reports from the <span class="ph">Backlot UI</span>, these events are selectable from the <span class="ph uicontrol">Plays</span> menu:

  <div class="section" id="concept_hyx_qlc_ck__displays"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Display Events, or "Player Loaded"</h2>
   
   <p class="p">Displays measure the number of times that a piece of video content is loaded and displayed
    within the player before it gets played (displays are related to each individual asset). Each
    time an embed code is changed, this event gets triggered by the Ooyala Player event
     <samp class="ph codeph">CONTENT_TREE_FETCHED</samp>, as noted in <a class="xref" href="../api/player_v3_api_events.html" title="Use message bus events to subscribe to or publish player events from video to ad playback.">Player V3 Message Bus Events (Deprecated)</a>.</p>

   <p class="p">Loading the player does not necessarily mean a video will be played, only that player has
    loaded. Some scenarios in which display events are generated but there is no play include the
    following:</p>

   <ul class="ul" id="concept_hyx_qlc_ck__ul_olj_dmc_ck">
    <li class="li">
     <p class="p"> No video autoplay, and the consumer does not click “play.”</p>

    </li>

    <li class="li">
     <p class="p"> Autoplay enabled, but consumer abandons page before player has time to start playing.</p>

    </li>

   </ul>

   <p class="p">Similarly, a single display event (or player load) can result in multiple video plays, for
    example if multiple videos in a playlist are viewed consecutively within the same player
    instance.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Play Events</h2>
   
   <p class="p">A play event measures the number of times that the "Play" button is triggered either manually
    or automatically. The requested content could be ad content or the actual video content (a play
    is counted regardless of which type of content is requested to play). Plays currently don’t
    include the Replay event.</p>

   <p class="p">This is triggered by the Ooyala Player event <samp class="ph codeph">WILL_PLAY_FROM_BEGINNING</samp>, as
    noted in <a class="xref" href="../api/player_v3_api_events.html" title="Use message bus events to subscribe to or publish player events from video to ad playback.">Player V3 Message Bus Events (Deprecated)</a>. </p>

   <p class="p">No distinction is made between pre-roll ads and the actual video asset itself. Either
    constitutes a "play." </p>

  </div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Play Start Events</h2>
   
   <p class="p">A "play start" event measures the number of times that actual non-ad video content starts
    playing. If the user initiates the playback experience and only watches a pre-roll ad without
    continuing on to the actual video content, a Play count is reported, but not a Start. Play
    Starts is only recorded if the user waits until the actual video starts playing back.</p>

   <p class="p">This is triggered by the Ooyala Player event <samp class="ph codeph">PLAYHEAD_TIME_CHANGED</samp>, as noted
    in <a class="xref" href="../api/player_v3_api_events.html" title="Use message bus events to subscribe to or publish player events from video to ad playback.">Player V3 Message Bus Events (Deprecated)</a>.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Examples</h2>
   
   <div class="p">In this example, a player configured to autoplay plays four videos back-to-back without
    interruption. An assumption here is that either there are no pre-roll ads or the viewer lets all
    pre-roll ads play and finally views the videos. <div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 1. Autoplay Four Consecutive Videos</span>
     
     <img class="image" src="../image/analytics_plays_example1.png" height="185" width="408"/>
    </div>
</div>

   <div class="p"> Below, the key difference from the first example is that the viewer abandons viewing during
    the pre-roll ad before the third video starts. In this example, for the third video, only the
    "play" event is recorded, not "play start" because the viewer abandons during the ad before the
    "play start" event can be recorded. <div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 2. Autoplayer with Pre-roll Ads, Viewer Abandons during Pre-roll Ad of Third Consecutive
      Video</span>
