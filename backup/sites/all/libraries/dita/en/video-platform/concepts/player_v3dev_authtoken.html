  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can authorize playback using the Ooyala Player Token.
    (Available only if your Ooyala account includes this functionality. To enable Ooyala Player Token, contact your account manager.)
  </p>

    <div class="section">Limiting playback exclusively to authorized users and exclusively on your page requires
      the communication of the token request URL to the player, so that the player can utilize this
      URL throughout authorization. This is accomplished with the following steps: <ul class="ul" id="player_v3dev_authtoken__internal-source-marker_0.9329864937735756">
        <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Generate a Token Request and Authorization URL</strong>. You generate the signed token
          request URL on the server-side, specifying a short expiration time as one of the
          query-string parameters. You must also include your provider code and a comma separated
          list of embed codes. This URL is passed to our player via a JavaScript callback; its short
          expiration time prevents it from being lifted from your page and used elsewhere. </li>

        <li class="li">
          <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Set the Token Expiration Time</strong>. You need to set an expiration time for the
            Playback Token in your Backlot Syndication tab. Note that this expiration time is
            independent of the token request expiration time. Its function is to specify how long
            the token (issued by Ooyala) will be valid, and it controls the
            viewer’s access to authorized players for the specified interval. space.</p>

        </li>

        <li class="li">
          <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Embed the URL to Issue Authorization</strong>. When the crafted token request URL is
            forwarded to the player, Ooyala’s authorization response will send an authorization/no-authorization decision.
            Once the client receives an affirmative authorization response, video playback is enabled. </p>

        </li>

        <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Playback Authorization.</strong> Before the video starts playing, the Ooyala player sends
          the authentication request and receives the token. When the authorization server validates
          the URL, it authorizes playing the content. The authorization is in effect until the
          session expires. If the session expires, the viewer needs to refresh the browser. </li>

      </ul>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If the URL is not valid, it will display an error message. For more information
        about the error, see the "Error Types" topic in this document.</div>
</div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Two Types of Expiration Times</h2>
      
      <div class="p"> With this design, you should note the difference between the two expiration times. You
        need to set: <ul class="ul" id="player_v3dev_authtoken__internal-source-marker_0.5012084729124661">
          <li class="li">One expiration time on the token request (the URL that will be embedded on the
            page—adjustable by the provider’s server-side implementation). Use a short expiration
            time on the URL snippet so that the snippet cannot be replicated across other domains
            (it can be embedded, but will become nonfunctional). </li>

          <li class="li">The other expiration time on the token object itself (expiry
            time adjustable through your Backlot account). A longer expiration time may be set (if
            desirable) on the token object, since the <a class="xref" href="http://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Same_Origin_Policy" target="_blank">Same Origin Policy</a> protects its distribution. </li>

        Rights Management (DRM) solutions that Ooyala provides (or supports) to ensure that users
        can have access to authorized content. You can also use the Ooyala Player Token in

            Protocol (RTMP) stream. </li>

          <li class="li">Encrypted delivery (such as RTMPE or HLS AES Encryption) to prevent recording of a
            stream. </li>

          <li class="li">DRM Technologies (such as Flash Access) to enforce usage rights on content.</li>
