          <li class="li">Web-based platforms and operating systems supporting JavaScript using the

      <p class="p">With this release, you can integrate Ooyala IQ with any player or device with one of
        our out-of-the-box SDKs or adapters or by integrating directly with the Ooyala IQ
        JSON API or JS SDK. We recommend that you use the JavaScript SDK for all platforms
        that support JavaScript and use the JSON API if your platform does not support
        JavaScript or if you are using Roku.</p>
      The following diagram shows how the
      integrations mentioned above integrate with Ooyala IQ. Items in light blue are managed

      <h2 class="title sectiontitle">What's New</h2>

      <p class="p">You can view metrics for Ooyala and non-Ooyala video assets in third-party
        (non-Ooyala) players.</p>

      <div class="p" id="analytics_v3_third_party_players__d15405e100">The <span class="ph">Ooyala IQ</span> UI has been adjusted to
        accommodate third-party player analytics. The adjustments include the following: <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li">The <em class="ph i">Player</em> panel shows the third-party player name when events come from a third-party player. For example, if you analyze events coming from JW player, you will see "JW Player" in the <em class="ph i">Player</em> panel. </li>

          <li class="li">If content metadata is not ingested into Backlot, Ooyala IQ provides graceful UI degradation. This means that Ooyala IQ can provide analytics for third-party player events without requiring metadata ingestion from a third-party CMS system. For example, if Ooyala IQ doesn't get a video asset's title metadata, it will use the video asset's external ID in place of the title (see image below for an example). <div class="fig fignone">
              <img class="image" src="../image/iq_standalone_without_metadata.png" height="175" width="445" />
            </div>

          </li>

          <li class="li"><span class="ph">If you are using Ooyala players and third-party players to play Ooyala video assets (hosted in Backlot), you can now use one Backlot account to stream video to an Ooyala player and a third-party player. You can view consolidated IQ analytics metrics in one dashboard (through one user account) for both types of players.</span>You can see the different metrics for your Ooyala players and third-party players by looking at the Player and Device panels. Please note that for third-party assets (hosted in a third-party CMS), you will still need to set up a separate Backlot provider account to ingest asset metadata.</li>

    <div class="section" id="analytics_v3_third_party_players__d15405e131">
      <h2 class="title sectiontitle">Getting Started with a Third-Party Player and Ooyala Assets</h2>

      <p class="p">If you are using a third-party player to play Ooyala assets (hosted by Ooyala), follow
        the steps below to integrate the third-party player events with Ooyala IQ.</p>

      <ol class="ol">
        <li class="li">Enable your third-party player to communicate player events to Ooyala IQ by integrating the Ooyala IQ JavaScript SDK or JSON API with your non-<span class="ph">Ooyala</span> video players by using one of the Ooyala out-of-the-box adapters or by building your own adapter. See <a class="xref" href="../tasks/analytics_v3_integrate_javascriptsdk.html">Integrating Third-Party Players with IQ Using the JS SDK</a> for details on the JavaScript SDK and <a class="xref" href="../tasks/analytics_v3_json_api.html">Ooyala IQ JSON API</a> for details on the JSON API. </li>

        <li class="li">Make sure that your Ooyala assets are playable on third-party players. <ol class="ol" type="a">
            <li class="li">Check that your account processing profile is set up to create streams that the third-party player can play. Please check with the third-party player to see what stream types it supports. You can ask your Customer Success Manager for assistance checking your processing profile. The third-party player can then use the Ooyala playback authorization APIs to access the streams it can use (which will vary based on the third-party player). <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> We recommend that you test a variety of streams transcoded by Ooyala on the target device prior to ingesting your asset library to Backlot to make sure the streams playback properly.</div>

            </li>

            <li class="li"> If you had to make changes to your processing profile to enable an encoding type, you will need to upload a new video file or re-encode the video file in order to get the newly generated file. Content replacement (replacing an asset) will not work for this step. You must upload a new file or open a support ticket with Brightcove Technical Support to reprocess the video without manually uploading it again to keep the same embed code.</li>

            <li class="li">Use the Backlot API to query: /assets/&lt;ASSET EMBED CODE&gt;/streams
              and copy the URL for the desired encoding.</li>

          </ol>

        </li>

        <li class="li">Create your third-party player as you normally would, specifying the encoding
          URL gathered from step 2c as the file path to the video. </li>

        <li class="li">Use the <a class="xref" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ooyala-analytics-plugin/kgkibeopmmkehaijmmfhldeclmgbmgnp" target="_blank">Ooyala Analytics Chrome
            Plugin</a> to validate that your analytics pings are being properly sent
          to the Ooyala backend, or ask your <span class="ph">Ooyala</span> Customer
          Success Manager to validate your asset metadata in Backlot and event pings.</li>

      </ol>

      <p class="p">After enabling your third-party player to play Ooyala assets, your IQ account will
        automatically start showing metrics for the third-party player when analytics events
        occur for your Ooyala assets.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="title sectiontitle">Getting Started with a Third-Party Player and Third-Party Assets</h2>

      <p class="p">If you are using a third-party player to play third-party assets (not hosted by
        Ooyala), follow the steps below to integrate the third-party player events with
        Ooyala IQ.</p>

      <ol class="ol">
        <li class="li">Create a trial Backlot account and ask your Customer Success Manager to enable
          the account for viewing your third-party assets and metadata in Backlot. You
          will view a simple version of Backlot that strips away irrelevant Backlot
          functionality. </li>

        <li class="li">Access <span class="ph">Ooyala IQ</span> at <a class="xref" href="http://analytics.ooyala.com" target="_blank">http://analytics.ooyala.com</a> or through the Backlot ANALYZE tab.</li>

        <li class="li">(Optional) Sync your content metadata in your non-<span class="ph">Ooyala</span>
          CMS with the <span class="ph">Ooyala</span> Backlot CMS so that you can identify
          your videos in IQ Standalone. We strongly recommend that you do this, because
          without syncing your metadata, you will not be able to view your video titles in
          the IQ Standalone user interface. See <a class="xref" href="../tasks/analytics_v3_ug_ingest_third_party_player.html">Syncing Third-Party Metadata with Ooyala IQ</a> for details on how to ingest your content metadata. Please talk to your
          Customer Success Manager if you want to work with <span class="ph">Ooyala</span>
          Professional Services for this step.</li>

        <li class="li">Implement the relevant SDK with your non-<span class="ph">Ooyala</span> video
          players. Please talk to your Customer Success Manager if you want to work with
          <span class="ph">Ooyala</span> Professional Services for this step.</li>

        <li class="li">Use the <a class="xref" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ooyala-analytics-plugin/kgkibeopmmkehaijmmfhldeclmgbmgnp" target="_blank">Ooyala Analytics Chrome
