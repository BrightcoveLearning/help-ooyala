 <h1 class="title topictitle1">Device Registration API</h1>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <div class="section">
   <p class="p">With Ooyala's device registration APIs, which are integrated with Ooyala <a class="xref" href="chapter_rightslocker.html">Rights Locker</a>, providers
    can comply with content owners’ requirements to limit the number of devices associated
    with a single viewer. A single consumer account (called a "viewer") can be limited to no
    more than a specific number of registered devices, after which limit has been reached,
    devices must be "de-registered" before other devices can be added. Only devices
    registered to the viewer are able to play videos published with the device limits
    policy. </p>

   <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Player V4 does not support device registration for Widevine Modular.</div>

   <div class="p">The device registration API comes in two forms.<ol class="ol" id="concept_r24_32h_3k__ol_fqc_3pj_qj">
    <li class="li">An API for client application programs to register, delete, and update of lists
     of viewers' devices. The endpoint for these API calls is
     <samp class="ph codeph">player.ooyala.com</samp>. This interface is suitable for you to
     create a viewer self-service "portal" through which the viewers themselves can
     manage their own registered devices, including creating easy-to-remember nicknames
     for their devices.</li>

    <li class="li">An API suitable for use by your customer support group to manage and view their
     viewers' specific accounts device history and modify device rules or settings not
     permitted by client application API described above. The endpoint for these API
     calls is <samp class="ph codeph">rl.ooyala.com</samp>. These calls must be signed by your
     provider secret key, as described at <a class="xref" href="api_keys.html" title="Your Ooyala API credentials include your API key and secret, which you provide to sign HTTP requests and when using the scratchpad.">Your API Credentials</a>.</li>

   </div>

   
   
   
   
   
   <p class="p">There are two limits associated with device registration:</p>

   
   <ol class="ol">
    <li class="li">Device limits: upper limit for the number of devices associated with a consumer
     account. This limit is provider-wide and applies to all of the provider's assets with
     the publishing rule <samp class="ph codeph">limit_devices_per_viewer</samp>. For any one specific
     provider, all assets subject to device limits have the same limit.</li>

    <li class="li">Deregistration rule: limit consumer account to deregister <em class="ph i">X</em> devices in
     <em class="ph i">Y</em> time interval. Ooyala enforces a limit on the number of deletions that can
     happen in a given time period. Applies provider-wide to all assets. </li>

   </ol>

   
   
   
   
   <p class="p">For each asset, settings are required:</p>

   <ol class="ol">
    <li class="li">The publishing rule "Require Ooyala Player Token" is required.
     <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Available only if your Ooyala account includes this functionality. To enable Ooyala Player Token, contact your account manager.</div>

    </li>

    
    <li class="li">The publishing rule <samp class="ph codeph">limit_devices_per_viewer</samp> sets whether the
     asset is restricted to registered devices.</li>

   </ol>

   
   <div class="p">These settings can be made in the Backlot UI under <strong class="ph b">Syndication Controls</strong> (which
    is for publishing rules), as shown below, or via the Backlot API for publishing rules.<div class="fig fignone">

    </div>
</div>

   <p class="p">Some other considerations:</p>

   
   <ul class="ul">         
    <li class="li">Ooyala does not provide an authentication service; it is assumed that your
     application has its own authentication model and service. </li>

    <li class="li">There is no explicit call to register a device.</li>

   </ul>

  </div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">High-level Flowchart for Programming the User Portal</h2>
   
   
   <div class="p">The logical flow of actions by the device registration application you write for the viewer
    self-service portal is described below. <div class="fig fignone">
     <img class="image" id="concept_r24_32h_3k__image_zd2_k42_rj" src="../image/deviceregistration_processflow.jpg" height="612" width="746"/>
    </div>

   </div>

   
   <ol class="ol">
    <li class="li">After authentication is complete, the provider’s identity service needs to create an
     Ooyala Player Token (OPT). The OPT is passed as part of the authorization request to obtain an
      <span class="keyword parmname">account_id</span>.</li>

    
    
    
    <li class="li">Application requests a DRM license for the DRM-protected stream. The license request is
     proxied via your authorization service to the license server; the authorization service
     attaches the <span class="keyword parmname">account_id</span> and <span class="keyword parmname">request_id</span> to the license
     request.</li>

    
    
    
    <li class="li"> As part of the license request for the DRM-protected asset, when a user tries to play an asset published with a “require user entitlement”
     policy, the entitlements for that specific user are checked against the Ooyala <a class="xref" href="chapter_rightslocker.html">Rights
      Locker</a>. If the asset’s
     policy includes device limits, Ooyala’s authorization service ensures that the current
     device is in the registered domain of devices for that user before granting the
     license. The DRM license servers generate a unique device id. The device id is
     encrypted and cannot be read by the client application.</li>

    
    
    
    <li class="li">As part of entitlement validation, Ooyala <a class="xref" href="chapter_rightslocker.html">Rights Locker</a> checks the device limits, based on the <span class="keyword parmname">account_id</span>
     and <span class="keyword parmname">device_id</span>. A successful check is necessary before a DRM license.
     Device Registration depends on the Ooyala Player Token for secure authentication
      (<span class="keyword parmname">account_id</span>) and DRM for robust, secure device ID. <p class="p">If all entitlement
      checks pass, the license is cryptographically bound to the device. Device registration will
      fail if the browser privacy settings/history/cache are cleared or if the browser is
      uninstalled or reinstalled. If any of these events occur, the widevine and <span class="keyword parmname">device_id</span> cached in the
      browser are removed. This could cause the device limit to be exceeded because the same device
      would then have a new <span class="keyword parmname">device_id</span> and be tracked as a new device.</p>
</li>

   
    <li class="li">If the device has not been registered, the provider can configure his service so that the
     device is auto-registered. If the user has not exceeded the device limits, auto-registration
     adds the device to the user’s device domain. (The user-agent string of the device is recorded
     automatically.) The user is authorized to proceed.<p class="p">For the Ooyala Flash Player, when an
      authorization token is issued or modified, the event <samp class="ph codeph">authTokenChanged</samp> is
      triggered. With the player message bus, you can listen for this event. For an example, see
       <a class="xref" href="../reference/player_v3_dev_listenevent.xml.html" target="_blank">Listening To a Message Bus Event</a>.</p>
<p class="p">At this point, you can optional
      automatically prompt the user for a device nickname. Of course, your user can also add a
      device nickname later, either via your user portal or your customer support portal.</p>
</li>

    <li class="li">If the user’s device limit has been exceeded, the system returns an error.
     <p class="p">The provider’s application can use APIs to retrieve error information and the user’s
     device nicknames to create a user experience that appropriately communicates the device
     limit restriction. The provider can use APIs to create a self-service portal and/or
     create a customer service capability to (de-) register devices.</p>
</li>

     <li class="li">When authorization
     fails, the client needs to make a request to user Portal API as defined below to get the
     reason for failure, and trigger the appropriate user experience for remedying the error.
     <p class="p">For the case where the number of devices has been reached, the user experience for
      deregistering a device can be triggered.</p>
</li>

    
    <li class="li">If the deregistration limit has not been reached, then the user can deregister
     device.
    
     <p class="p">The application should try again to get a license.</p>
</li>

    
     <li class="li">The user  might have to wait for the deregistration time limit before successfully obtaining the license.</li>

    
    <li class="li">Otherwise, the user must talk to the
     provider's customer support, who can use Device Registration APIs to override
     restrictions.</li>
