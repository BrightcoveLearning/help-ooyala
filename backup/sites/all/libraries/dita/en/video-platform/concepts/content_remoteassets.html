   <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> After a remote asset has been created, its
        propagation to the various CDNs might be delayed 60 seconds or more. If you request a remote
        asset too soon after its creation, the results will be cached by the CDNs, which might take
        several minutes to clear. Best practice: after creation, wait 30 or 60 seconds, query with
        the <span class="ph">Backlot API</span>
        <samp class="ph codeph">[GET] /v2/assets/<var class="keyword varname">asset_id</var></samp> route, and after retrieving
        the remote asset's embed code (content ID or asset ID), then proceed to embed the asset. </div>
