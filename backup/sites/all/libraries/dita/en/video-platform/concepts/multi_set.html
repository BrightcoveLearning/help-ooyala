            <p class="p">The Ooyala Player (for both Web and SDKs) selects the audio track based on a variety
                of settings, in a specific priority order. Since the default track can be set in a
                variety of ways, the order of priority must also be understood. </p>

            <u class="ph u">Default Audio Selection</u>
            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The following are the ways to set the default language of a multi-audio track
                generally. If the user manually changes the language, this sets the player’s
                language priority (web player only) for future visits. In the iOS and Android SDKs,
                the user-level language selection is stored for the app session only. User language
                preference history takes priority over any of the settings below, assuming the next
                video has this same language available.</div>
<p class="p">In the order of highest priority to
                lowest priority:</p>
<ol class="ol">
                <li class="li">Page level / app level param. This is a deliberate setting from the customer to
                    lock the default setting.</li>

                <li class="li">Skin.json setting. Same as above. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> #1 and #2 should have the following values:<ul class="ul">
                            <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">none</samp>. This is the default setting. This means that
                                there is no manual setting from the page/app level. Audio selection
                                should be decided by the priorities below. </li>

                            <li class="li">specified language or trackID.</li>

                            <li class="li">browser or OS or platform setting. Detect the language setting from
                                the parent of the container. <ul class="ul">
                                    <li class="li">If the selection does not exist on the manifest, the
                                        selection should be decided by the priorities below.</li>

                                    <li class="li">If the selection contains multiple of the same kind (i.e.
                                        multiple of same languageCode), choose the first
                                        available.</li>

                                </ul>

                <li class="li">Back-end API: ContentTree, i.e: custom metadata key value pair from backlot that

                        attribute.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The Ooyala Web Player does not currently support setting the
