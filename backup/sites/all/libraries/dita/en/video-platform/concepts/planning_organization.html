 <h1 class="title topictitle1">Content Organization</h1>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph">Ooyala</span> provides many ways to display, distribute, and
  monetize content. Organizing your content simplifies these decisions and enables you to test
  different strategies for different groups of content. </p>

  <p class="p"> When organizing your content, consider the following: </p>

  <ul class="ul">
   <li class="li">Player requirements—will all of your content use a single player or do you want a
    different player for different types of content? Do you need different players for different
    customers or brands? For more information on players, see <a class="xref" href="chapter_players.html" title="Describes how to create and configure Ooyala players using the Backlot UI.">Managing Players in Backlot</a>. </li>

   <li class="li"> Content sources—you can upload videos directly, use remote assets that are hosted
    outside of <span class="ph">Ooyala</span>, or even source videos from YouTube. For more
    information about content types, see <a class="xref" href="../reference/content_types.html" title="Ooyala supports these popular content types.">Supported Content Types</a>. </li>

   <li class="li"> Monetization goals—<span class="ph">Ooyala</span> enables you to monetize your
    content through advertising and paywalls. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="chapter_monetization.html" title="Ooyala enables you to monetize your content through advertising and paywalls.">Monetization</a>. </li>

   <li class="li"> Where your content will be published—you can embed content on your website, upload to
    YouTube, syndicate to iTunes, syndicate to Boxee feeds, syndicate to Podcasts, and much more.
    For more information, see <a class="xref" href="chapter_publishing.html" title="Publishing lets you share videos and video metadata with multiple web properties and content networks.">Content Publishing</a>. For information on setting which content is syndicated, see <a class="xref" href="chapter_labels.html" title="When added to external publishing targets, labels specify which videos, channels, and channel sets to publish externally.">Labels</a>. </li>

   <li class="li"> Categorization—<span class="ph">Ooyala</span> enables you to categorize your
    content using labels. Once set up, you can group videos by labels, publish videos by labels, and
    view analytics by labels. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="chapter_labels.html" title="When added to external publishing targets, labels specify which videos, channels, and channel sets to publish externally.">Labels</a>. </li>

   <li class="li"> Content rules—you can specify where your content can play using geographic
    restrictions, when your content can play using time restrictions, and where your content can be
    embedded using domain restrictions. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="chapter_publishing_rules.html" title="Publishing rules give you complete control over your content by enabling you to control where and when it can be viewed.">Publishing Rules</a>. </li>

   <li class="li"> Playlists and standalone content—do you plan to deliver individual videos,
    groups of videos, or both? A playlist is a group of videos that a viewer sees through a single player. 
    The viewer will see a series of videos in the order that you specify or videos that use 
    the labels that you specify. For more
    information, see <a class="xref" href="chapter_theme_builder.html" title="With Theme Builder, you can build asset- or label-based playlists for the Ooyala Player V4 or Player V3, use complex templates to build a custom playback experience, and create an embed that contains the playlists you construct.">Playlists and the Theme Builder User Interface</a>. </li>
