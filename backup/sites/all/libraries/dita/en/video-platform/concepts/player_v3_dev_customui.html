  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"> Ooyala provides many options for customizing the appearance and functionality of an
    HTML5 Player V3 when it is loaded. </p>

    <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Ooyala Player V3 is deprecated and is scheduled
    to be <em class="ph i">disabled</em> on 2018-01-31. After that date, Player V3 will no longer play your video
    or audio content. Customers still using Player V3 need to migrate to Player V4 (see <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_v3.html">Migrating from Player V3</a> and <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_faq.html">Player Migration FAQ</a>).</div>

    <div class="section">You can embed your player in a div container and use JavaScript  and CSS to customize
      the player experience. In addition, you can use CSS styling to modify the player container
      appearance with any of the available CSS and CSS3 styles. Before you use the CSS3 styles and
      the CSS styles, you need to make sure that your target browsers support these styles. <p class="p">By
        enabling you to use CSS to customize your player experience, the player provides a
        convenient and efficient separation of some aspects of UI customization from backend player
        functionality. The player also enables you to customize player functionality using
        JavaScript APIs instead of query string parameters. Instead of working with both query
        string parameters and JavaScript, you can use JavaScript to create the functionality that
        you want for your HTML5 player, which allows you to retain your Flash player functionality
        as well.</p>
