 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">This topic introduces Player V3 run-time events. It applies to Ooyala's web-based
    players (HTML5 and Flash) and mobile native app players (iOS and Android).</p>

   <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Ooyala Player V3 is deprecated and is scheduled
    to be <em class="ph i">disabled</em> on 2018-01-31. After that date, Player V3 will no longer play your video
    or audio content. Customers still using Player V3 need to migrate to Player V4 (see <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_v3.html">Migrating from Player V3</a> and <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_faq.html">Player Migration FAQ</a>).</div>

   <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">About Player V3 Run-time Events</h2> Player run-time events can be triggered
      in either of the following ways: <ul class="ul" id="player_event__ul_c3g_dqm_ss">
        <li class="li">manually by end user actions (for example, clicking the play or pause button)</li>

        <li class="li">programmatically via an API call</li>

      </ul>
</div>

    <div class="section">Here are some examples of common playback events: <ul class="ul" id="player_event__ul_fp4_dqm_ss">
        <li class="li">play has started</li>

        <li class="li">play has completed</li>

        <li class="li">an ad has started playing</li>

        <li class="li">one or more ads have completed playing</li>

        <li class="li">an error has occurred</li>

      </ul>
Events can trigger changes in the player state. For example, a user clicking the play
      button fires the "play has started" event and changes the player state to "playing". For more
      information, see <a class="xref" href="player_state.html" title="This topic introduces Player V3 run-time states. It applies to Ooyala's web-based players (HTML5 / Flash) and mobile native app players (iOS and Android).">Player V3 Run-time States (Deprecated)</a>. </div>

   <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Developer Resources for Player V3 Run-time Events</h2>Ooyala's developer
      resources provide event listeners, event notifications, and callback functions that fire when
      certain run-time events occur. Due to different technical requirements across platforms, the
      list of player events varies by platform. Some states are common across platforms (such as
      play starting or stopping), while many others are platform-specific. In addition, the names of
      the player events differ across platforms to be consistent with platform SDK conventions.
      Refer to the following resources to learn more about player run-time events.
