      <div class="section" id="analytics_user_content_perf__content_performance">        
         <p class="p"> The items in the legend on the left of the tab are color-coded to the lines on the
            chart.</p>
<p class="p"> To hide a metric from the chart, deselect the check box to the left of the metric's name in the

         <p class="p">The metrics shown on the Performance tab include:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="analytics_v3_dictionary.html#analytics_v3_dictionary__displays"><span class="ph uicontrol">Displays:</span></a> This is a count of the occurrences of
               the display event, which means the embed code has changed
               (new content loaded). </li>

            <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="analytics_v3_dictionary.html#analytics_v3_dictionary__plays"><span class="ph uicontrol">Plays Requested:</span></a> The number of times the "play"
               button is triggered either manually or automatically. This is a count of the
               occurrences of the playRequested
               
               event, which means that any video content (including ad video content) was
                  requested.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> We have improved our calculation of this metric. You may see the
                  number of plays requested from your HTML5 and SDK players increase after
                  11/11/2014 due to this implementation.</div>
</li>

            <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="analytics_v3_dictionary.html#analytics_v3_dictionary__starts"><span class="ph uicontrol">Video Starts: </span></a>The number of times users started
               watching actual video content (non-ad content).This is a count of the occurrences of
               the
               playStarted
               event, which means that the requested video content (not ad content) has begun actual
               playback. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> We have improved our calculation of this metric. You may see the
                  number of video starts from your HTML5 and SDK players decrease after 11/11/2014
                  due to this implementation.</div>

            <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="analytics_v3_dictionary.html#analytics_v3_dictionary__play_conversion_rate"><span class="ph uicontrol">Play Conversion Rate:</span></a> Ratio of plays requested
               events to displays events. The Play Conversion Rate view is useful for any publisher
               trying to understand the CTR (click-through-rate) between videos being presented to a
               consumer on their site or app, and the consumer's willingness to clickthrough and
               play. Autoplay players interfere with this ratio. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> We have improved our
                  calculation of plays requested. You may see the play conversion rate metric from
                  your HTML5 and SDK players increase after 11/11/2014 due to this
                  implementation.</div>

            <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="analytics_v3_dictionary.html#analytics_v3_dictionary__start_conversion_rate"><span class="ph uicontrol">Video Conversion Rate:</span></a> Ratio of video starts
               events to plays requested events. The Video Conversion Rate view is useful for any
               publishers that provide some form of "bumpers" before the video starts or runs
               pre-roll ads to track the abandonment rate of consumers that exit the player before
               the requested video begins.  <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> We have improved our calculation of video starts
                  and plays requested. You may see the number of video starts from your HTML5 and
                  SDK players change after 11/11/2014 due to this implementation.</div>

         <p class="p">Refer to the conceptual overview for a <a class="xref" href="analytics_v3_howanalyticsworks.html">graphic
               depiction of the displays, plays, and video starts (and other events) for a typical
               video</a>. The first three events in the graphic equate to display, play
            requested, and video start.</p>

      <div class="section" id="analytics_user_content_perf__time_segments"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Time Segments</h2>
          On the upper right of the chart is a series of buttons you can
         use to change the granularity (the level of detail) of the displayed data: <div class="fig fignone">

         </div>

         <p class="p">The following time segments are available:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">15 Mins</li>

            <li class="li">Hour</li>

            <li class="li">Month</li>

         <p class="p">The default time segment is Day.</p>

         
         <div class="note note" id="analytics_user_content_perf__date_known_issue"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p">The default date range for the day time segment is different from the default date range for the 15 minute and hour time segments.</p>

            <p class="p">For the day time segment the default date range is from 12:00am of the first day to 11:59pm of the last day in the week (8 24 hour segments). For the 15 minute and hour time segments the default date range is from 12:00pm of the first day to 12:00pm of the last day in the week (7 24 hour segments).</p>

            <p class="p">This difference in default date range means that your metric data will change when
               you switch between the day time segment and the 15 minute or hour time segments. We
               will change the date range limitation for 15 minute and hour time segments to match
               the day time range (8 24 hour segments) in an upcoming release.</p>
