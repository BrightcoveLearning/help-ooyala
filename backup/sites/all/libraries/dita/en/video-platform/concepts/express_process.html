  <div class="body conbody">
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Standard processing queue</h2>The standard processing queue for VOD content
      follows FIFO (first in first out) logic. Every customer can process 10 jobs in parallel
      (unless their contract indicates higher, as there is additional cost). So if more than 10
      assets are ingested at the same time, the rest of the assets remain in the queue and are
      processed based on FIFO. Often, one of the assets uploaded later might need to be processed
      first due to time sensitive nature of the content. To support this use case, OoyalaADAPT has
      an “Express processing queue”.</div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Express processing queue</h2>
      
      <p class="p">For every customer, in addition to the standard processing queue, an express processing queue is available. The express processing queue can process five jobs in parallel (unless their contract indicates higher, as there is additional cost). Consider the express processing queue as a carpool or high volume lane in a highway. Once a job is submitted to the express processing queue, it gets higher priority than jobs in standard processing, and is picked ahead of jobs in the standard processing queue. However, the express processing queue also uses the FIFO logic and any more than five assets submitted to this queue remain queued until an open slot is available.
      </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you submit all jobs to the express processing queue, then there is no difference between the standard and express queues.</div>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">How to use the Express Processing Queue</h2>
      
      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> You cannot edit or delete express transcoding that is set already. If you need this to be 
        removed for any reason, please contact Ooyala Support.
      </div>

      <div class="p">There are currently three ways to submit jobs to a job to the express processing queue:<ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">During <a class="xref" href="../../../../../../../video-platform/tasks/ingestion_ftp_xml.html" target="_blank">manifest-based content ingestion</a>, add the

</li>

        <li class="li">If an asset has already been ingested to the standard processing queue, you can use the API to move it to the express processing queue.

      <p class="p">Q: What is the default concurrency limit of the standard processing queue?</p>

      <p class="p">A: The default concurrency limit of the standard processing queue is 10 jobs. A job includes all outputs (HLS,DASH, MP4 etc.) associated with the processing profile. </p>

    <p class="p"/>

      <p class="p">Q: What is the default concurrency limit of the express processing queue?</p>

      <p class="p">A: The default concurrency limit of the express processing queue is five jobs. A job
        includes all outputs (HLS,DASH, MP4 etc) associated with the processing profile.</p>

    <p class="p"/>

      <p class="p">Q: Can I have a higher concurrency limit for my standard/express processing queue?</p>

      <p class="p">A: There is an additional cost for a higher concurrency limit, unless stated in your contract. Please contact your account manager for further details.</p>
