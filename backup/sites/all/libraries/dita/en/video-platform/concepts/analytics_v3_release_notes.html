                        <li class="li">Enable your third-party player to communicate player events to Ooyala IQ

                            out-of-the-box adapters or by building your own adapter. </li>

                        <li class="li">Make sure that your Ooyala assets are playable on third-party players by
                            checking that your video assets are .mp4 files and that you have the
                            correct encoding profile to allow .mp4 files to be encoded.</li>

                        <li class="li">Create your third-party player, making sure to reference the URL to your
                            .mp4 video asset, the asset's embed code, and to specify the asset type
                            as mp4.</li>

                IQ) with any third-party system (non-<span class="ph">Ooyala</span> video players). </p>

                <div class="p">The <span class="ph">Ooyala IQ</span> UI has been adjusted to
                accommodate third-party player analytics. The adjustments include the following: <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">The <em class="ph i">Player</em> panel shows the third-party player name
                        when events come from a third-party player. For example, if you analyze
                        events coming from JW player, you will see "JW Player" in the <em class="ph i">Player</em> panel. </li>

                    <li class="li">If content metadata is not ingested into Backlot, Ooyala IQ provides
                        graceful UI degradation. This means that Ooyala IQ can provide analytics for
                        third-party player events without requiring metadata ingestion from a
                        third-party CMS system. For example, if Ooyala IQ doesn't get a video
                        asset's title metadata, it will use the video asset's external ID in place
                        of the title (see image below for an example). <div class="fig fignone">

                    geographies, and players. You will get what your top performed URLs are for each

                        page.</div>

            <p class="p">Ooyala IQ is Ooyala’s new video analytics product built on top of our reliable,
                robust, and scalable big data architecture, providing real-time analytics as well as
                multi-dimensional analytics capability to give a full 360-degree view of video
                consumption and engagement patterns. It is a major upgrade to the existing Ooyala
                Analytics product and will be available for all Ooyala customers at no additional
                cost.</p>

            <div class="p">The following capabilities are new: <ol class="ol">
                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Newly designed user interface built in HTML:</strong>
                        <p class="p">The new HTML UI removes the reliance on a Flash plugin, provides the
                            ability to access IQ on various devices (e.g. iPad), and offers
                            performance improvements.</p>
</li>

                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">New multi-dimensional analytics capability:</strong>
                        <p class="p">With Ooyala’s new multi-dimensional querying capability, you can now run
                            analytics across multiple dimensions, including Device Type (e.g.
                            Mobile, Tablet, Desktop, Set-top Box, etc.), OS/Browser, Geography
                            (Country, Region, State/Province, DMA), Domain, Player, Asset or Label.
                            This will help address your more complex business questions such as “How
                            many unique viewers from the United States and Canada do I have for a
                            subset of videos consumed on Tablet - iOS during the last

                        <p class="p">The new Video Details page will give you a holistic, detailed view into
                            the performance of an asset. Apart from uniques and engagement data,
                            you’ll now be able to view key asset metadata, key performance metrics
                            for the asset, and asset consumption broken down by each dimension. You
                            can access the Video Details page directly from either the Dashboard or
                            the Business Intelligence page simply by clicking on the asset. This
                            increased accessibility, along with detailed performance of a specific
                            asset, allows you to quickly identify consumption and engagement
                            patterns for that asset.</p>

                        <p class="p">The new real-time Dashboard in Ooyala IQ will show you the top 10 videos
                            and their viewership data in real-time, while the old analytics product
                            only shows the top 3 videos in real-time.</p>

                            would only be counted when all pre-roll ads are completed and the actual
                            video content starts playing. By comparing Plays Requested (referred to
                            as Plays in the old v2 analytics) and Video Starts, you will be able to
                            see the viewer drop-off due to pre-roll ads.</p>
