    <p class="p">A prerequisite to displaying language-specific closed captions for any video on mobile
      devices is to set up a <a class="xref" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/CR-ttaf1-dfxp-20061116/" target="_blank">Distribution Exchange Format Profile (DFXP)</a> (now TTML)
      file for each asset that includes the captions in the desired languages. This file must be
      uploaded to Backlot and associated with the video itself.</p>

    <div class="p">
      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> No programming with the Ooyala Mobile SDK is required for this most basic setup.</div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">DFXP (now TTML) Format</h2>
      <p class="p">Ooyala only supports the DFXP v2006 format.Multiple languages can be included in a single
        DFXP (now TTML) file; for details on format, see <a class="xref" href="../reference/dfxp_format.html" title="Closed caption files that you upload to Backlot must be in a supported format.

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Uploading</h2>
      
      <p class="p">After you have prepared the DFXP (now TTML) file, it can be uploaded to Backlot either with
        the Backlot UI, as described in <a class="xref" href="../api/asset_closed_caption.html" title="You can add closed captions to videos, ads, remote assets, or YouTube videos.">Working with Closed Captions</a>, or with the Backlot
