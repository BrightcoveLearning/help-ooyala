   <p class="p">Cross-Device Resume (XDR) gives viewers the flexibility to start
        watching a video on one device and continue watching it on the same or different device at a
        later time, automatically resuming where the viewer left off. A secure server architecture
        is required. This architecture, REST API requests, and programmatic calls in JavaScript for
        Player v3, Objective C for the Ooyala Mobile SDK for iOS, and Java for the Ooyala Mobile SDk
        for Android are fully detailed in <a class="xref" href="chapter_xdr.html#chapter_xdr" title="Cross-device resume (XDR) enables viewers to start watching a video on one device, pause it, and continue to play it later from a different device. Ooyala Player (V4 and V3) and the mobile SDKs support cross-device resumption of playback, in conjunction with Ooyala's REST APIs.">Cross-device Resume (XDR)</a>.</p>
