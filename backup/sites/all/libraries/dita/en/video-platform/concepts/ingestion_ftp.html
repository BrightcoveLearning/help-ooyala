  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">About FTP / FTPS</h2>FTP is a standard network protocol for transferring files
      from one computer to another. For OIS v2.5, FTPS (FTP over SSL) is required. FTP is used for
      OIS v1, which is deprecated.</div>

    <div class="section">Most operating systems support FTP natively, and you can choose from many FTP client
      applications. You can automate FTP uploads by writing scripts, have users bulk upload videos
      through a Windows, Mac, or Linux application, or have users bulk upload videos through a
      browser (e.g., FireFTP). <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> You can use any FTP client to upload videos to
      Backlot.</div>
</div>

   <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Account Policy</h2>Your account is limited to a maximum of 100GB on the
      ingestion server at any time. If you expect to upload more content, you can request a
      temporary increase from your Customer Success Manager or Technical Support. </div>

   <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Getting Ingest Credentials</h2>You need to obtain ingest credentials in order
      to upload files to Ooyala via FTP. <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Setting Up an Upload-only User in Backlot (OIS
          v2.5)</strong></p>

     <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you want to use both basic and manifest-based ingestion, you need to create separate, uniquely-named, upload-only user accounts for each (for example, <samp class="ph codeph">user1_basic@example.com</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">user1_manifest@example.com</samp>).</div>
  
     <ol class="ol">
        <li class="li">In the Backlot GUI (Account &gt; User Management), add a user with Upload Only permissions
          to your account (see <a class="xref" href="chapter_usermanagement.html" title="Use the User Management subtab under the ACCOUNT tab to manage users associated with your Backlot account and control what they can do.">Managing Users</a>).</li>

        <li class="li">Configure the password for this account.</li>

   <div class="section" id="ingestion_ftp__vr360_metadata"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Setting VR 360 File Metadata</h2>
     <p class="p">If you are uploading a VR 360 video file, first label the file as VR 360 and tell which
        type of VR 360 it is, monoscopic or stereoscopic. Use file metadata to transmit this
        information.</p>

     <p class="p">You can set VR 360 file metadata in the manifest file (see <a class="xref" href="ingestion_fileformats.html">Manifest File Formats</a>). </p>

      <p class="p">If you are not using a manifest file, indicate the file type by setting file metadata with
        the <samp class="ph codeph">ffmpeg</samp> command-line utility.
        For example, suppose you are going to upload a Matroska (.mkv) file.
       With this type of file, you can create a custom metadata tag named 
       <samp class="ph codeph">vr360type</samp> and assign it one of the following values:
       <samp class="ph codeph">mono</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">stereo_lr</samp>.  
       For example:</p>

     <pre class="pre codeblock">ffmpeg -i inputFile.mkv -c copy -metadata "vr360type=mono" outputFile.mkv</pre>

     <p class="p">Some file formats do not support custom metadata. For example, with MP4 files,
          <samp class="ph codeph">ffmpeg</samp> allows only predefined metadata tags. As a workaround, use the
        general-purpose <samp class="ph codeph">description</samp> field with predefined values to indicate the VR
        360 file type. The value of <samp class="ph codeph">description</samp> must include the text <samp class="ph codeph">VR
          360</samp> and one of the following: <samp class="ph codeph">mono</samp> or
        <samp class="ph codeph">stereo_lr</samp>.  For example:</p>

     <pre class="pre codeblock">ffmpeg -i inputFile.mp4 -c copy -metadata "description"="VR 360 Type is mono ..."  outputFile.mp4</pre>

     <p class="p">For more information about VR 360, see 
       <a class="xref" href="vr360.html">VR 360 Videos</a>.</p>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Ingesting with an FTP / FTPS Client</h2>You can upload a video via FTP / FTPS
      either with or without a manifest. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> All upload files must comply with the ingest
        requirements described in <a class="xref" href="../reference/input_formats.html" title="Before uploading content to Backlot, make sure you are using a supported file format and following the best practices for source files.">Supported Ingest Formats</a></div>

        <li class="li">Ooyala suggests that you upload the manifest file last.</li>

      </ol>
Files are deleted right after they are all processed. Submitted files that do not go
      through the entire ingestion workflow (for example, awaiting the upload of the manifest file)
      are deleted from the server after 7 days. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Special characters(non-ASCII) in file names
        are not supported when files are ingested via FTP and manifest based ingestion is
