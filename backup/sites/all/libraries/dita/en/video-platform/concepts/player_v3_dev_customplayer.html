 <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Ooyala Player V3 is deprecated and is scheduled
    to be <em class="ph i">disabled</em> on 2018-01-31. After that date, Player V3 will no longer play your video
    or audio content. Customers still using Player V3 need to migrate to Player V4 (see <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_v3.html">Migrating from Player V3</a> and <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_faq.html">Player Migration FAQ</a>).</div>

   <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This section applies to the HTML5 Player V3 and the Flash Player V3.</div>

   <p class="p">You can customize the behavior and functionality of the player using the Player JavaScript
    APIs for ads, assets, events, and error handling, and you can customize the appearance of the
    player by specifying its cascading style sheets (CSS) attributes. The following sections
    describe these customization options.</p>
