    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Popular Now</strong>: The Popular Now subsection lists the content that has the largest number
                                        of users watching it right now. Use the paging buttons to
                                        move from page to page.</p>

   </li>

   <li class="li">
    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Top 10 Countries by Current Users</strong>: A real-time global heat
                                        map.
                                        The global heat map shows where your content is being viewed
                                        in the world. The darker the shade of blue is, the more
                                        viewers you have. The orange dots show cities with the
                                        highest viewership. Use the slider on the left to zoom in or
                                        out. </p>

    <p class="p">Underneath the map, the top ten country list scrolls through the top ten countries,
                                        displaying the number of current users in each and the
                                        percentage the country represents out of the current total
                                        viewers.</p>

   </li>

   <li class="li">
    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Trending Past Hour</strong>: A list of the top videos, with the number of users who viewed
                                        them, that have had the largest percentage increase in
                                        engagement (momentum) in the most recent 60 minutes. This
                                        display has multiple pages. Use the numbers in the upper
                                        right corner to switch between pages. Momentum is calculated
                                        using a combination of time watched and the hourly increase
                                        of a video's performance against its baseline. <span class="ph">Ooyala</span> supports different time
                                        window sizes, and the baseline will always be the next
                                        larger time window (in the case of a time window of the past
                                        day, the baseline would be the past week). A video that was
                                        watched for 1000 minutes during the last hour and an average
                                        of 500 minutes for the day has a higher momentum than a
                                        video that was watched for 500 minutes during the current
                                        hour and an average of 500 minutes for the day. This section
                                        is updated every 20 to 40 minutes. </p>

   <li class="li">
    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Top Content</strong>: Contains two subsections: a graph and a list of top content. The graph
          shows plays requested, displays, or hours of play for the period of time you specify. The
          top content list shows content with the most plays requested, displays, or hours of play
          during the same period.</p>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">What's Changed From <span class="ph">Ooyala Now</span> to the Dashboard</h2>
  <p class="p">The dashboard has been updated. Formerly known as the <span class="ph">Ooyala Now</span> page,
                                the dashboard received cosmetic and functional improvements. A
                                functional improvement is that <span class="ph">Ooyala Now</span>
                                could only show up to three top popular videos based on the total
                                concurrent users. The new dashboard can show up to ten of the top
                                popular videos based on the total concurrent users. </p>
