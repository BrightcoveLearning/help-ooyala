    <div class="body conbody">
<div class="section">Before you add HEVC as an available codec for
    your video streaming, be sure to consider the benefits versus the additional costs that
    are associated. While the HEVC codec is more efficient and will subsequently provide
    lower CDN usage and a better playback experience in general, how significant these
    benefits will be depends upon your audience possessing devices that can support HEVC.
    Because support for the HEVC varies by platform, HEVC stream usage potential might not
    be significant for your audience. And while adding HEVC streams is not an additional
    direct cost from Ooyala, it does typically mean you will have more encoding costs. This
    is because you will typically need by HEVC (h.265) and AVC (h.264) stream support,
    meaning HEVC is an additive codec rather than a replacement.</div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Customer
        Considerations for Adding HEVC Streams</h2><p class="p">Before adding HEVC to their
            profile, customers should consider the following issues:</p>
<ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Bitrate and bandwidth savings.</strong> Compared with H.264, adding the HEVC codec
                    will provide approximately 30% bitrate savings. For playback at the same
                    resolution, HEVC will therefore require approximately 30% less bandwidth. In
                    addition to some CDN savings, audiences will enjoy a higher quality of
                    experience (higher resolutions will be achieved at the same bandwidth). </li>

                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Increased transcoding time and costs.</strong> HEVC codecs will typically double
                    the amount of transcoding needed per asset, because unsupported devices will
                    still need the AVC assets. Increased transcoding time increases transcoding
                    costs. Because HEVC cannot be appended to an existing asset, adding HEVC to
                    already transcoded assets will require the reprocessing of those assets. </li>

                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Support for the HEVC codec is limited.</strong> Therefore, based on anticipated
                    audience consumption for the supported environments, customers should determine
                    whether the device coverage they gain is worth the additional transcoding
                    costs.</li>

                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Android:</strong> Android 5+ devices, and only devices that have either
                        hardware or software decoders for HEVC. The Ooyala Player will confirm at
                        run-time, prior to playback. whether an HEVC decoder (hardware or software)
                        is available on the device. Additionally, since our stream encoders are
                        generating CMAF HLS to be compatible with iOS devices, only MPEG-DASH
                        streams are supported with HEVC. </li>

                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">iOS:</strong> iOS 11 plus A10+ Chips (iPhone 7 and greater models).
                        Additionally, iPhone 6 (A8 chipset) can support HEVC). iPhone 5 has some
                        support with the A7 chip, but cannot support the higher bitrates compared to
                        the later chipsets. </li>

<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <strong class="ph b">For older Apple devices:</strong> On some older devices, support for
                    HEVC is also affected by the resolution and frame rate (fps) of the video. However,
                    Ooyala does not support these older devices, in order to reduce the risk of a
                    bitrate ladder ramp that fails. Devices in this category include: <ul class="ul" id="hevc__ul_eft_g2d_kdb">
