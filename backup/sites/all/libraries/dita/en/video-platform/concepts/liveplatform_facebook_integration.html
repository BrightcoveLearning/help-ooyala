    <div class="body conbody">
        <div class="p">At the <a class="xref" href="https://www.fbf8.com/" target="_blank">Facebook
                Developer's Conference</a> held on April 12, 2016, Facebook announced its live
            streaming service (Facebook Live), and named Ooyala as a Media Solutions â€“ Live Video
            Solutions partner. The Ooyala-Facebook live integration (<a class="xref" href="http://go.ooyala.com/facebooklive" target="_blank">ooyala.com/facebooklive</a>) enables Ooyala Live customers to publish instantly
            to a Facebook page using Facebook's <a class="xref" href="http://go.https//developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/live-video-apiooyala.com/facebooklive" target="_blank">Live Graph API</a>. Here is an overview:<div class="fig fignone" id="liveplatform_facebook_integeration__fig_bps_4mr_wv">
                <img class="image" id="liveplatform_facebook_integeration__image_omr_qmr_wv" src="../image/ls_facebook_live_overview.png" height="310" width="586"/>
            </div>
<ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">The Ooyala Live platform leverages the <a class="xref" href="http://www.elementaltechnologies.com/products/elemental-live" target="_blank">Elemental Live</a> encoder to push the
                    live stream to a Facebook Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) ingest point. The
                    stream format aligns with Facebook-recommended specifications: 720p (720x1280)
                    at 30 frames per second, an I-frame every 2 seconds, and a bitrate of 2500
                    kbps.</li>

                <li class="li">Ooyala's channel-based integration uses Facebook's <a class="xref" href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/live-video-api" target="_blank">Live Graph API</a> to post a live video on
                    a Facebook user's page.</li>

            </ul>
</div>

        <p class="p">For Ooyala Live customers who subscribe to the integration service, setting up the
            integration involves a single extra step in the channel configurations instructions (see
                <a class="xref" href="../tasks/liveplatform_setup_channel.html#liveplatform_setup_channel" title="Use the Channels page to add new channels and to view all the channels you have created.">Setting Up a Channel</a>).
            When defining packaging (choose <span class="ph uicontrol">Ooyala Package</span>) and encoding
            partners for a channel, you simply click the <span class="ph uicontrol">Facebook Syndication</span>
            checkbox.</p>

        <div class="p">An additional RTMP stream is dynamically added to your live channel when
                <span class="ph uicontrol">Facebook Syndication</span> is enabled. No special profile is
                needed.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> You can enable syndication to all the Facebook pages for which your
                Facebook credentials have admin rights.</div>
</div>

        <p class="p">When you start the channel, you provide login credentials for the Facebook account you
            want to use, and then select a page (already created by the user in Facebook) on which
            you want to post the live stream. Facebook responds (behind the scenes) with the URL of
            the RTMP ingest point. Thereafter, the live stream appears in Facebook (the channel name
            becomes the title of the live stream).</p>

        <div class="p">
            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> You can create one Facebook login for each channel you create, and you can create
                multiple channels. Each user having access to the channel associated with the
                Facebook page name listed on the <span class="ph uicontrol">Channel Details</span> can view the
                channel streaming on that Facebook page. Multiple users may have access to the same
                Facebook login for a given channel.</div>

        </div>

        <p class="p">Ooyala Live can also multicast an RTMP live stream to Facebook and Ooyala Players at the
            same time. In the Encoding setup, the second output (RTMP) goes to Facebook.</p>

        <p class="p">Ooyala offers integration with Facebook Live as a free add on. Check with your Ooyala
            representative to determine if your current Ooyala Live setup supports Facebook
            syndication. </p>

        <p class="p">During the channel creation process, you can log into your Facebook account and select
            the page to which you want to publish a live streaming channel. Your
                <span class="ph uicontrol">Channels</span> page, when running, will display Facebook-related
            information, including the Facebook account name and page name. When your channel is in
            a stopped state, you can remove Facebook syndication, modify the Facebook account name
            and page selection, and set a duration to run an RTMP push to Facebook. You can also set
            the <span class="ph uicontrol">Stream duration (Minutes)</span> to the length of time you want to
            publish to Facebook: The maximum is 240 minutes. This maximum is a limitation set by
            Facebook. </p>

        <p class="p">This feature is available for all channels created after May 31, 2016.</p>
