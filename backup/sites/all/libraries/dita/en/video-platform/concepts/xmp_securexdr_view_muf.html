    playback experience with Ooyala Cross-Device Resume and Google IMA ads integration and adding
    Player Token authentication.</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Ooyala Player V3 has been deprecated and is scheduled to be
    disabled. For details and alternatives, see the <a class="xref" href="../relnotes/2017-06-04.html">OVP
     Release Notes</a>.</div>

      <p class="p">The code sample includes multiple client web pages or views illustrating each feature and a
        seventh code sample that shows all the features working in combination. To implement each
        client page, you will need all the standard elements that you normally use such as your API
        Key, pcode, and so forth. </p>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"> Multi-Feature SampleÂ </h2>Our public GitHub repository also contains the
        <samp class="ph codeph">multi-feature_sample.php</samp> file. This file contains the server side code and
      a client web page that combines all the client-side code for implementing all of the features
      described in the prior sections so you can see a single working sample that demonstrates ads
      integration with Google IMA, Ooyala Cross-Device Resume, and authentication with the Ooyala
      Player Token. It also includes the PHP Server-Side code to handle requests. </div>
