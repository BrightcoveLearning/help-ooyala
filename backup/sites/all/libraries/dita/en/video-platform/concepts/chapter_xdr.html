 <h1 class="title topictitle1">Cross-device Resume (XDR)</h1>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Cross-device resume (XDR) enables viewers to start watching a video on one device, pause
  it, and continue to play it later from a different device. Ooyala Player (V4 and V3) and the
  mobile SDKs support cross-device resumption of playback, in conjunction with Ooyala's REST APIs. </p>

  <div class="section"><div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This functionality applies to Ooyala <span class="ph">Player V4</span> and <span class="ph">Player V3</span> (Deprecated).</div>
</div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">About Cross-device Resume</h2>Ooyala's XDR service records per-user viewing
   activity, storing the most recent play position so that playback can resume even if the device
   changes. XDR benefits include: <ul class="ul">
    <li class="li">Allows viewers start a video on one device and pick up watching where they left off on
     another device.</li>

    <li class="li">Is supported by any player that uses the IQ JSON API, for instance Roku or Xbox One.</li>

    <li class="li">Works with assets hosted in Backlot and third-party content-management systems.</li>

    <li class="li">Integrates into your customer website or mobile device app through a combination of
     REST-based APIs and native language calls on desktop or mobile devices. </li>

   </ul>
<p class="p">XDR history is available for 90 days per viewer. 
   </p>
</div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Enabling XDR</h2>XDR must be explicitly enabled for your account. Contact
   Ooyala Sales, your Customer Success Manager, or Brightcove Technical Support to request XDR. </div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Supported Configurations</h2>
   
   <p class="p">Ooyala's XDR requires the capability to gather information about the viewer's
    playback position. As such, it works on players and player apps that support Ooyala's Analytics. </p>

   <ul class="ul">
    <li class="li">XDR is fully supported by Player V4, Flash Player V3, and HTML5 V3 Player on either desktop
     or mobile devices.</li>

    <li class="li">XDR is supported by the Ooyala Mobile SDK for Android and Mobile SDK for iOS. Â </li>

   </ul>

   <ul class="ul" id="chapter_xdr__ul_iyh_l1y_xl">
    <li class="li">To work with XDR in the Mobile SDK, you need the Mobile SDK itself, <p class="p">You can download the Mobile SDK from <span class="ph">Ooyala <a class="xref" href="../../../../../../../downloads.html" target="_blank">Downloads</a></span>. Click the appropriate version to download a zipfile of the Mobile SDK
        package.</p>
</li>

    <li class="li">Your Ooyala-provided provider code (sometimes called "pcode"), API key, and secret. For
     information about where to obtain these, see <a class="xref" href="api_keys.html" title="Your Ooyala API credentials include your API key and secret, which you provide to sign HTTP requests and when using the scratchpad.">Your API Credentials</a>.</li>

    <li class="li">Code to sign your REST API requests. The signing algorithm is fully explained at <a class="xref" href="../tasks/api_signing_requests.html" title="Every request made to Backlot requires three query string parameters for authentication: API key, request expiration, and signature. This topic tells how to generate the signature.">General Algorithm for Signing Requests</a>.</li>

    <li class="li">A customer service or other portal that can communicate both with Ooyala's API services and
     with your client application (desktop or mobile).</li>

    <li class="li">A user identifier of some kind, which is referred to as an "account ID". For recommendations
     on how to secure your account IDs, see <a class="xref" href="rightslocker_accountsecurity.html">Your Users, Your Accounts: Security</a>.</li>
