 <h1 class="title topictitle1">About Discovering and Recommending Content</h1>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph" id="discovery_phrase">Discovery enables you to keep users engaged by directing them to related and relevant
  content on your site. Discovery learns continuously from video impressions and plays to provide
  users with a dynamic, personalized experience.</span></p>

  <div class="section" id="chapter_content_discovery__discovery_intro">Using Discovery, you can recommend: <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">Videos based on content popularity or velocity for the current hour, day, week, or
          month.</li>

        <li class="li">Videos with usage patterns that are similar to a selected video. </li>

      </ul>
</div>

  <div class="section" id="chapter_content_discovery__discovery_enable"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Enabling Discovery for Your Account</h2>
      Discovery must be explicitly enabled for
      your Ooyala Backlot account. If it is not already enabled, contact your Ooyala account
      representative to activate Discovery features for your site.</div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Recommendations Engine and Player</h2>
   <p class="p">Discovery involves two key components:</p>

   <ul class="ul">
     <li class="li">Ooyala provides a patented video recommendations engine that uses machine learning
     algorithms to make personalized recommendations. </li>

     <li class="li">The Ooyala player provides a pre-integrated user interface with autoplay for viewing and
     navigating the results generated by the recommendations engine.</li>

   </ul>

   <p class="p">The player and the recommendations engine interact in the background. The Discovery
    recommendations engine is also available directly via an API.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Configuring Discovery</h2>
   <p class="p">There are two main ways in which to configure Discovery:</p>

   <div class="p">
    <ul class="ul">
     <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Backlot UI</strong> is easy, straightforward, and sufficient for configuring the Discovery
       in-player experience. For details, see <a class="xref" href="discovery_config.html" title="Learn how to configure personalized recommendations and how the Ooyala player displays recommendations when video playback ends or pauses.">Configuring Discovery in the Backlot UI</a>. </li>

     <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discovery API</strong> provides programmatic access to the Discovery recommendations engine
            for presenting tailored content to users in content carousels on your site. For details,
            see the <a class="xref" href="cd_api_overview.html" title="To use these Discovery APIs, you make Discovery requests and return user action information to train the algorithms.">Discovery REST APIs</a>.</li>

    </ul>

   </div>

   <p class="p">You can change settings in the recommendations engine to influence the results. You can
    customize the user experience by configuring player display settings in Backlot to change how
    videos are shown to the user, how the user selects them, timing, previews, end screen styles,
    and so on. You typically configure an Ooyala player to display recommendations on the End Screen
    and, optionally, the Pause Screen.</p>

    <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Discovery and Playlists (created using ThemeBuilder) each control end
    screen behavior, so you cannot use them together. When you embed a player on a web page, you can
    use <em class="ph i">either</em> Discovery or Playlists, but not both.</div>
