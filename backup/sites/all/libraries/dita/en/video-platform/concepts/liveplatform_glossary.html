  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Find and understand all the terminology behind Ooyala Live.</p>

     <dl class="dl">
      
       <dt class="dt dlterm">Ad-hoc Events</dt>

       <dd class="dd">Unplanned events that typically only have short notice before the stream is live for
        consumer viewing.</dd>

      
      
       <dt class="dt dlterm">Archive</dt>

       <dd class="dd">A saved recording of the Ooyala Live event or program, made available through Backlot, that
        uses the same embed code as the Live event or program. The Archives for both Azure Media
        Services and Akamai SecureHD are not proper assets, in that we cannot retrieve them as an asset
        to ingest into our VOD transcoding system and cannot syndicate or import into an editing system
        to create clips. </dd>

      
      
       <dt class="dt dlterm">Asset</dt>

       <dd class="dd">A generic term referring to video and other types of content.</dd>

      
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Channel</dt>

      <dd class="dd">Channels enable live streaming, including the ingestion through the CDN to the end
       playback device. A channel receives live input streams from a live transcoder and makes them
       available for streaming. A channel can also have multiple programs. A channel is not exposed
       to a player, except via an embed code. For example, there is no specific concept as a channel
       in the CMS related to the new Live Platform; there is usually 1 - 1 relationship between a
       channel and a schedule. Events depend on a Channel. Thus, an ad-hoc event will be streamed on
       a Channel. Typical operations are that providers will have a channel configured that will
       persist even though it may only be used for streaming ad-hoc events.</dd>

     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">DVR</dt>

      <dd class="dd">Digital Video Recorder. When creating an Ooyala Live event, setting the <span class="ph uicontrol">DVR
        Duration Override</span> override the duration of the archive for DVRs.</dd>

     
     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Dynamic Ad Insertion (DAI)</dt>

      <dd class="dd">The ability to stitch ad content into video streams by modifying the video manifest before the content is delivered to the player.</dd>

     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Dynamic Manifest Management (DMM)</dt>

      <dd class="dd">The ability to dynamically generate manifests based on business rules. Required for DAI.</dd>

     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Egress</dt>

      <dd class="dd">The path from the CDN back to the Origin. The higher the effectiveness of the CDN’s caching within its delivery network, the lower the Egress bandwidth used.</dd>

      
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Embed Code</dt>

      <dd class="dd">Ooyala-specific content or asset ID. On the Live Platform, each channel and event has a
       unique embed code. Note that recorded archives will have the same embed code as the source
       live event or program.</dd>

     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Encoding</dt>

      <dd class="dd">An Ooyala Live encoder converts the source audio and/or video into one of the
       acceptable live stream formats in a single bitrate for input into Ooyala Live.</dd>

     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Entry or Ingest Point</dt>

      <dd class="dd">The URL address configured to receive the output of the encoder that is streaming the live source video.</dd>

     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Event</dt>

      <dd class="dd">The point in time that is recorded from the streaming content of a channel.</dd>

     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Ingress</dt>

      <dd class="dd">The path for the input stream from the Ooyala Live encoder to the Entry Point.</dd>

     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Linear</dt>

      <dd class="dd">Generally a constant video stream as in 24/7 broadcast TV, and may also include a channel that is only streaming live content a portion of each day.</dd>

     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Live</dt>

      <dd class="dd">Real-time streams from an actual live event, i.e., from camera to end-user; sometimes used as a broader term for live events, simulcast of broadcast streams, etc.</dd>

     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Live Origin</dt>

      <dd class="dd">A central location from which a CDN can retrieve encoded video content, manifests, and a DVR buffer.</dd>

     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Live-to-VOD</dt>

      <dd class="dd">Refers to a broad-range of uses, such as the creation of live clips and archive recordings of live events.</dd>

     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Monitoring</dt>

      <dd class="dd">Monitoring the stream directly using telemetry data, as well as Ooyala Live
       itself.</dd>

     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Quality of Service (QoS)</dt>

      <dd class="dd">Metrics reflecting the playback characteristics of the video stream from the perspective of the end-device, e.g. buffering.</dd>

     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Remote Asset</dt>

      <dd class="dd">Video assets as represented within the CMS system (Backlot), addressed using an embed code, and can be an event or channel.</dd>

     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Repackaging</dt>

      <dd class="dd">Converting streams of a single format into different formats for delivery such as DASH and HLS; repackaging is the same process as transcoding or packaging for VOD. DRM may also be applied during repackaging.</dd>

     
     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Schedule</dt>

      <dd class="dd">An EPG container for Events that are streamed on a channel.</dd>

     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Single Sign On (SSO)</dt>

      <dd class="dd">Ooyala Live integrates with Backlot and provides the administrator with Single Sign On
       capability. The Ooyala Live sign-in uses the same account credentials for user authentication
       as Backlot. Login syntax is identical to Backlot's such that the "Username" is the user's
       email address and password is the password of the user. </dd>

     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Slate</dt>

      <dd class="dd">A still image that is used for display within the player during times that the end-user
       is not intended to view the live stream; slates can be encoded, and the stream in the
       outbound stream or the playback device can switch the user’s video window to display the
       slate.</dd>

      
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Telemetry</dt>

      <dd class="dd">Metrics reflecting the availability of the video stream as it exists within the encoding/transcoding video pipeline.</dd>

     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Transcoding</dt>

      <dd class="dd">Converting a single bit-rate input stream into multiple bit rate streams of the same format; transcoding merely creates multiple streams from one, modifying the bit rate, and possibly frame size and resolution, but generally not the frame rate and not the format (one H.264-encoded RTMP stream becomes several RTMP streams of differing quality bitrates/frame sizes).</dd>

     
     
      <dt class="dt dlterm">Trimming</dt>

      <dd class="dd">The archive is a recording of a live event (or program) and retains the same embed code
       of the live event (or program). Because live events typically will have the live source
       stream active before the actual start of the event, it may be desirable to trim the pre- and
       post-event content removed from the saved archive. Trimming preserves the embed code.</dd>
