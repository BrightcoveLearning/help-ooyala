        seventh code sample that shows all the features working in combination. To implement each

        Key, pcode, and so forth. </p>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Cross Device Resume (XDR) Client Code</h2> The
        <samp class="ph codeph">cross_resume.php</samp> file code implements a client-side version of Ooyala Cross
      Device Resume (XDR) as a sample. We have implemented a simple version of XDR so you can see
      how it works. Cross-Device Resume, of course, is designed to work with our mobile SDKs and
      from the desktop or mobile device to an appropriate TV type. For more information about XDR,
      see “ <a class="xref" href="player_v3_dev_xdintro.html" title="The Ooyala Player includes support for Cross-Device Resume (XDR) that enables you to provide a seamless video experience across multiple devices."> "Player
        for Cross Device Resume."</a><div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Before you work with any feature, including Ooyala
        Cross Device Resume (XDR), you need to make sure the feature is enabled. Contact your
        Customer Success Manager to set this up. If you do not have XDR enabled, you can make a
        request but the server will give you an empty response. You may not be able to quickly debug
        the empty response as there is no specific message indicating that you have not enabled the
        feature.  Make sure you have the feature enabled before you start. </div>
</div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">How the XDR Sample Works</h2>
      
      <p class="p">In implementing XDR for this sample, we limited the code to perform XDR from desktop to
        desktop for simplicity.  XDR supports start and resume across mobile devices, desktops,  and
        XTV enabled TVs. For more information about XDR, see “ <a class="xref" href="player_v3_dev_xdintro.html" title="The Ooyala Player includes support for Cross-Device Resume (XDR) that enables you to provide a seamless video experience across multiple devices.">Player for Cross Device
          Resume.</a>”</p>

      <p class="p">In this XDR client sample, we pass the playhead time from the PHP server to var
        playheadTime. We create the player with <span class="keyword apiname">OO.Player.create ()</span> function and
        set the <samp class="ph codeph"><strong class="ph b">embedToken</strong></samp> parameter and pass the
            <samp class="ph codeph"><strong class="ph b">playheadTime</strong></samp> to the <samp class="ph codeph"><strong class="ph b">initialTime</strong></samp>
        parameter.</p>
