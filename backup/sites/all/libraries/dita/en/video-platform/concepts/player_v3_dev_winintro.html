<div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Ooyala Player V3 is deprecated and is scheduled
    to be <em class="ph i">disabled</em> on 2018-01-31. After that date, Player V3 will no longer play your video
    or audio content. Customers still using Player V3 need to migrate to Player V4 (see <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_v3.html">Migrating from Player V3</a> and <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_faq.html">Player Migration FAQ</a>).</div>

  <div class="section">The Microsoft Windows 8 UI is a new design philosophy and application development
   platform that lets you build apps that conform to Windows 8 style principles. The <span class="ph">Ooyala</span> Player supports the embedding of Ooyala HTML5 players on devices

This topic describes how to use the Player on Windows 8 devices. </div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">About the Windows 8 Player App</h2>
   
   <p class="p">The app that you create for Windows 8 will feature an HTML5 player that automatically expands to 
    fullscreen mode when a user selects the app tile. You can set the player to not have UI controls (chromeless) and add your 
    custom components to the player and app. One other aspect of developing a player app for Windows 8 is 
    that if has a different method of distribution that is similar to what is done for iOS and Android 
    player apps. That is, when you create an app for Windows 8, you need to distribute it through the 
    Windows app store. For testing purposes, this means when you are in dev mode you cannot sideload your 
    app in another device and test it. However, you can test by running the app in test mode in a simulator.</p>

   <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> When you create your Ooyala player app for Windows 8 in Visual Studio, the project wizard will 
    auto create a shell or template of a default.js file that has the boilerplate contents needed for this file. 
    You will need to add your logic and perhaps tweak some of the boilerplate but much of it will be provided.</div>
