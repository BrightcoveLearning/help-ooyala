        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Prerequisites</h2>
             Before you use Theme Builder, ensure you have a collection
            of videos in Backlot. If you want to use labels to create playlists automatically,
            define any required labels in Backlot. </div>

            <p class="p">To learn how to use the Theme Builder UI, see <a class="xref" href="theme_builder_accessing.html" title="Theme Builder is accessible with the same username and password you use on Backlot.">Logging into Theme Builder</a>
                and the topics that follow.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Playlists</strong></p>

            <p class="p">Playlists are ordered groupings of video content.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Playlist Carousels (also known as Pods) </strong></p>

            <p class="p">Playlist Carousels display your custom playlists with the player.</p>

                    Embeds</strong></p>

            <p class="p">A Theme Builder embed is one or more playlists embedded within a player. You must
                create the embed yourself.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b" id="dg_theme_builder_overview__docs-internal-guid-bbe85538-7fff-7891-0b99-c9c681859afe">Theme Builder
                    Playlist CSS Class Names</strong></p>

            <p class="p">Theme Builder relies on Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to stylize the player and
                playlists.</p>

            <p class="p">Players let your viewers watch your video content.</p>

            <div class="p">To create the players you want to use with Theme Builder, you can use either of the following:<ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">The Backlot GUI. See <a class="xref" href="../../../devs/en/concepts/player_backlot_intro.html" target="_blank">Setting up Players Using the Backlot REST
                            API (Deprecated)</a>.</li>

                    <li class="li">The Backlot API /v2/players route. See Players (<a class="xref" href="https://docs.brightcove.com/apidocs-ooyala/backlot_api/index.html" target="_blank">Backlot REST API</a>).</li>

            <p class="p">Playlists are ordered groupings of video content.</p>

            <p class="p">You can build playlists by specific video assets or by label. With playlists, you can
                control the content your viewers can access within a theme. You can also organize
                the content in the playlist. For example, you can create a western theme and have it
                contain a playlist filled with western movies, ordered by release date.</p>

            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
                <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">The maximum number of videos you can add to a playlist is 64.</li>

                    <li class="li">The maximum number of labels you can associate with a playlist is 16.</li>

                    <li class="li">Allow some time for the playlist you create to be propagated through the
                        Ooyala systems. If you are doing a demonstration, it is best to use
                        playlists you have created previously.</li>

                </ul>

            </div>

            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Playlists are not visible by default. If you do not enable playlist carousels for
                your player, playlists are not visible to users. To make playlists visible to users,
                enable playlist carousels by associating the playlist and playlist carousel with a
                player.</div>
