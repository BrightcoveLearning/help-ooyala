            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How do I migrate from Player V3 to Player V4?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong> To load existing video assets with Player V4, simply create a new Player
                V4 and associate the Asset ID of the existing video with the new player. You can use
                the Backlot UI to configure many player settings (see <a class="xref" href="../tasks/player_configure.html">Configuring a Player in Backlot</a>), and you have additional
                customization options as well (see <a class="xref" href="pbv4_customize.html">Customizing the Player V4 Appearance</a>). If you use ads, you might need to update your ad configuration
                parameters. With the <a class="xref" href="pbv4_ads_framework.html">Ad Manager Framework</a>, configuration parameters and some page level settings are different from Player
                V3. If you don't have any page level overrides to Backlot settings, your ads will
                have full backwards compatibility. See <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_v3.html">Migrating from Player V3</a> for full
                migration steps and details.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How long do I have to migrate from Player V3 to Player V4?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Player V3 is deprecated and is scheduled to be disabled on 2018-01-31.
                After that date, Player V3 will no longer play your video or audio content.
                Customers still using Player V3 need to migrate to Player V4 before that date.
                Contact your Ooyala account representative for assistance. </p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How do I enable Flash-free playback for Player V4?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>By default, the Ooyala player uses the Flash plugin to playback HLS across all browsers. The bit_wrapper plugin for DASH and HLS (bit_wrapper.min.js) plays HLS using the HTML5 standard (and Media Source Extensions), enabling HLS on web browsers without the use of Flash. HTML5 MSE also supports playback of MPEG-DASH (clear and DRM-protected content). To enable Flash-free playback using the Ooyala player, see <a class="xref" href="pbv4_flash_free.html">Using Flash-free Playback with Player V4</a>. 

            </p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What happens if I have a custom Ooyala Player Framework (OPF) Flash
                module for Player V3?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>OPF modules in Player V3 were developed to allow you to integrate with
                third-party analytics providers and make UI/UX customizations (swf files, etc.). The
                    <a class="xref" href="pbv4_analytics_framework.html">Analytics Framework</a> allows you
                to integrate third-party analytics with the player. You can use the Analytics
                Framework to re-create your integrations with third-party analytics providers.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Will custom skins created for Player V3 work with Player V4?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Player V4 CSS customizations are made by modifying html5-skin.min.css. If
                you have built your own CSS for Player V3, you will need to re-create these skin
                customizations with html5-skin.min.css for Player V4. For details, see <a class="xref" href="pbv4_css.html">Customizing the Player V4 Appearance Using CSS</a>.</p>

            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Do I need to reprocess my clear assets to move from Player V3 to Player V4?</strong></p>

            <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>No, not usually. Re-processing is required only if: <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">You want to add DASH encoding to your processing profile.</li>

                    <li class="li">You want to add HLS to your processing profile and you have MP4 or HDS ONLY encodings.</li>

                </ul>
</div>

            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Do I need to reprocess my DRM-protected assets to move from Player V3 to Player
                    V4?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Yes. Reprocessing is required in order to support <a class="xref" href="../api/player_v3_fairplay_api.html" title="The Ooyala Player API for Apple FairPlay provides server-side support for Apple's FairPlay Streaming (FPS) by processing an FPS key request and returning a key response (CKC). Once you send your FPS credentials to Ooyala, at runtime your asset gets its CKC using Player API routes.">Apple Fairplay</a> HLS
                (Apple requires Apple-issued certificates), <a class="xref" href="widevine_modular.html">Widevine Modular</a>,
                and <a class="xref" href="player_v3dev_playreadyintro.html" title="Ooyala provides support for PlayReady to meet the content protection requirements for high-quality content online in on-demand and live streaming formats.">Playready</a> DASH. </p>

            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Are there any changes to the Player APIs and message bus?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Yes, query string parameters, certain embedded parameters, and certain
                player events used with Player V3 are no longer supported. There are also many new
                parameters and events introduced with Player V4. A complete list of changes is
                captured in <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_versions.html">Differences Between Player Versions</a>.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How do I embed the player in third-party websites - is it the same as Player
                    V3? Whereâ€™s the hosted iframe.html?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The player can be loaded in any third party, fourth party site . The iFrame
                can actually be found in the player 'embed' tab. See <a class="xref" href="../reference/pbv4_embed_iframe.html">Embedding Player V4 in an HTML iframe</a> for details.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: I see Player V3 and Player V4 embeds in the Backlot UI. What is the difference
                    between them?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The Player V3 embeds will load Player V3 only. The Player V4 HTML5 embed
                will load Player V4. Player V3 embeds will continue to coexist with the Player V4
                HTML5 embed while Ooyala continues to support Player V3. The Player V4 embed allows
                you to simply copy and paste the page script into an HTML page.</p>
