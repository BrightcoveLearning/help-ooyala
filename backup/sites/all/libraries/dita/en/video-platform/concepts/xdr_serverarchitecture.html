 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">For security, you need a server to communicate with Ooyala's servers, rather than
    directly from your client application.</p>

  <div class="section">
  <p class="p">This topic provides a high-level architectural overview to implement cross-device resume (XDR).
        This architecture applies to XDR for both the desktop and the Ooyala Mobile SDKs. </p>

  <p class="p">As a viewer watches a video, Ooyala video players continuously record the playhead position of
        a video being watched. (Custom players also must record this position.) XDR involves
        securely retrieving this recorded playhead position and resuming the video at that position.
        This is accomplished through the interworking of several Ooyala components, including two
        REST-based APIs and standard Player V3 JavaScript or the Ooyala Mobile SDK for iOS or for
        Android. </p>

  <div class="p">A key assumption of this architecture is that you have a customer portal or site that
        authenticates your viewers by way of login to ensure that they have rights to view your
        content. Another security concern requires that you have an intermediate server or service
        between your client and Ooyala's services. The reason is that the REST API request to
        retrieve playback position must be signed by your Ooyala-provided provider code (sometimes
        called "pcode"), API key and secret (for details, see <a class="xref" href="api_keys.html" title="Your Ooyala API credentials include your API key and secret, which you provide to sign HTTP requests and when using the scratchpad.">Your API Credentials</a>); these must not be embedded in your application itself. <div class="fig fignone">
