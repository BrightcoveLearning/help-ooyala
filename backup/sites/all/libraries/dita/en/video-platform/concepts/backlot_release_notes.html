      To support updated Apple requirements for podcast feeds, the following fields were added to the PUBLISH &gt; External Publication subtab for configuring Podcast syndication:
      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Language</span> - language used in the audio file</li>

      Apple requires selections for both of these fields. In addition, the Album Art description was updated to reflect the latest Apple requirements for image resolution sizes. For details, see <a class="xref" href="../tasks/syndication_podcast.html">Syndication with Podcast</a>.

      You can now configure mid-stream checks for geographic restrictions in publishing rules. Previously, geographic restrictions were checked only once, at the beginning of a stream. Now you can configure checks to occur at regular intervals during playback. This feature provides an additional level of security for blocking users from using VPNs to get around geographic restrictions on secured content. If a user moves outside of the specified geographic restriction, this is detected at the next interval and playback is stopped. This functionality requires the Ooyala Player Token (OPT).
