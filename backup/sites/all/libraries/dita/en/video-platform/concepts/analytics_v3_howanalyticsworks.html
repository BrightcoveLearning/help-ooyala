         <div class="section">
         During playback, video players send event-based metrics that are recorded along various
            dimensions, summarized, and aggregated for reporting and analysis. After presenting some key concepts, this overview describes the major components of <span class="ph">Ooyala IQ</span>.
         </div>


      <div class="section" xml:lang="en-us" lang="en-us" id="understandanalytics__keyConcepts.d0e16"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Key Concepts</h2>
         

            <p class="p">Three ideas are essential to understanding <span class="ph">Ooyala IQ</span>: 1)
               facts, 2) events, and 3) dimensions. These points are described below.</p>

            <div class="p">
               <ol class="ol">
                  <li class="li">All information measured by <span class="ph">Ooyala IQ</span> is tied to an
                     asset (usually a video or live stream). In traditional analytics terminology,
                     the video is called a fact. Every video has a unique identifying number, called
                     an identifier. </li>

                  <li class="li">As a video is played, video players record
                     events
                     (such as <span class="ph">“display”</span>, <span class="ph">“playStarted”</span>, or <span class="ph">“complete”</span>) over time in the
                     life of the video. Your videos (facts) and their associated events are the
                     basis for all metrics. </li>

                  <li class="li">Every event/video combination also has predefined aspects called dimensions
                     (or attributes) that relate to the fact, such as traffic source, player,
                     geography, and device.</li>

               </ol>

               
            </div>

            <p class="p"><span class="ph">Ooyala IQ</span> records data from events over time along the
               following predefined dimensions during playback.

            <p class="p">Each step is discussed in the remainder of this section. </p>

      <div class="section" xml:lang="en-us" lang="en-us" id="understandanalytics__recordingMetricData"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Recording Metric Data</h2>
         

            <p class="p">In the first step, to collect metrics, certain events that happen during playback are
               recorded by the video player as they occur, such as <span class="ph">"playStarted"</span>, <span class="ph">"pause"</span>, and others. These events are
               "data ticks" sent via a Representational State Transfer (REST) application
               programming interface (API) over the Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP). A single
               event or group of events sent in a single request is sometimes called a ping. </p>

            <p class="p">
               
            </p>

            <p class="p"/>

            <p class="p">Events are recorded in a database called the event store.</p>


      </div>

      <div class="section" xml:lang="en-us" lang="en-us" id="understandanalytics__aggregatingAndSummarizingData"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Aggregating and Summarizing Data</h2>

            <p class="p">In the second step, throughout the day, <span class="ph">Ooyala IQ</span> summarizes
               and aggregates these event-driven metrics into various time “chunks” (or segments),
               such as daily, monthly, or yearly.
               </p>

            <div class="p">
               <div class="fig fignone">
                  <img class="image" id="understandanalytics__image_qpg_yrj_xl" src="../image/analytics_v3_DataAgregation.png" height="211" width="266"/>
               </div>

            </div>

            <p class="p">"Aggregation" means that the intersections among the various dimensions are
               precomputed so reports are faster. For instance, aggregation anticipates that you
               will want to ask questions like “Which devices were used in which geographies?” or
                “Which players were used on which devices?” These “overlaps” are the overlapping
               parts of the diagram above.</p>

            <p class="p">Other data transformations can also occur, such as calculating other metrics based on
               the raw data.</p>

            <p class="p">The end result of aggregation, summarization, and other transformations is datacubes
               that store these precomputed intersections. </p>


      </div>

      <div class="section" xml:lang="en-us" lang="en-us" id="understandanalytics__reportingAnalysesAndDataVisualization"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Reporting, Analyses, and Data Visualization</h2>
         

            <p class="p">In the third step, after the metrics have been <a class="xref" href="#understandanalytics__aggregatingAndSummarizingData">gathered, summarized,
                  and aggregated, and the datacubes created</a>, the data is ready for you to
               use.</p>

            <div class="p">
               <div class="fig fignone">
                  <img class="image" id="understandanalytics__image_ern_1sj_xl" src="../image/analytics_v3_MultidimensionalAnalysis.png" height="176" width="305"/>
               </div>

            </div>

            <p class="p">So you can zero in on the particular relationship of the data that you are most
               interested in, you can access analytics data in several different ways:</p>

            <ol class="ol">
               <li class="li">The GUI, which includes the following: <ul class="ul" id="understandanalytics__ul_dng_gsj_xl">
                     <li class="li">
                        <p class="p">The Dashboard for near real-time analysis. </p>

                     </li>

                     <li class="li">
                        <p class="p">The Business Intelligence page, where data can be filtered by the various
                           dimensions or manipulated in other ways.</p>

                     </li>

                     <li class="li">
                        <p class="p">The Video Details page, where you can look at detailed metric breakdowns
                           for a specific video. </p>

                        
                     </li>

                  </ul>

               </li>

               <li class="li">A REST-over-HTTP API, which can be used for data downloading or for feeding into
                  your own reporting systems.</li>

               
            </ol>

            <p class="p">You can create multidimensional analyses to visualize intersections of the data.
               Multidimensional means more than one dimension. As mentioned in the previous section,
               you might want to answer the question “Which devices were used in which geographies?”
               or  “Which players were used on which devices?” Both questions are answered with
               multi-dimensional analyses.</p>

            <p class="p">Analyses with dimensions rely on the precomputed datacubes described above. </p>

            <p class="p">You can also constrain the data by filters (such filtering is sometimes known as
               slicing and dicing). You can apply filters such as date, geography, and so on, so
               that the amount of data you view becomes more and more sharply focused. You can thus
               view only the subsets of the data that interest you.</p>
