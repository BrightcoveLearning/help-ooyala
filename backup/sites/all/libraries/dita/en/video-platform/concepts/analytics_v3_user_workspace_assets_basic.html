      <p class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol">Video Details</span> page is part of the larger collections on the
            <span class="ph uicontrol">Business Intelligence</span> page. Any time you click the name or title
         of a video (or any asset), you are shown the <span class="ph uicontrol">Video Details</span> page. </p>

      <p class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol">Video Details</span> page has performance and engagement data for the
         video.</p>

      <p class="p">To export reports on the Video Details page as CSV files, click the download icon. <img class="image" src="../image/analytics_v3_download_icon.png"/> </p>

      <div class="p">The Video Details page is divided into four main regions: <ol class="ol">
            <li class="li">The video section, which contains the key performance indicator (KPI) bar, the video
               itself, and video information.</li>

            <li class="li">The Segments Watched section, which shows the plays requested count plotted against
               the video duration. 1 segment is defined as 2.5% of video length. There could be a
               case where your count for video starts is higher than the number of viewers who
               watched the entirety of the first segment. Some users may drop off before the first
               1/40th of the video completes.<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Note: </strong>If a user rewinds and watches the same
                  segment N times, Segments Watched for that segment will count as N times.</p>

      <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Time Segments</h2>
          On the upper right of the chart is a series of buttons you can

            <p class="p">For the day time segment the default date range is from 12:00am of the first day to 11:59pm of the last day in the week (8 24 hour segments). For the 15 minute and hour time segments the default date range is from 12:00pm of the first day to 12:00pm of the last day in the week (7 24 hour segments).</p>

            <p class="p">This difference in default date range means that your metric data will change when
               you switch between the day time segment and the 15 minute or hour time segments. We
               will change the date range limitation for 15 minute and hour time segments to match
               the day time range (8 24 hour segments) in an upcoming release.</p>
