   <div class="note warning"><span class="warningtitle">Warning:</span> The v2 Analytics API has been deprecated. See <a class="xref" href="ooyala_iq_developer_guide.html">Ooyala IQ Analytics</a> for more details on the new v3 Analytics

  <p class="p">Data that is unavailable to Ooyala might include the age and gender of the users, whether they
   are free or paying users, language, political leanings, and so on. </p>

  <p class="p">Custom analytics enables you to inject custom information that you can use to create custom reports.  To use custom analytics, you dynamically specify one or more tags in the client code at time of embed. When a user accesses the asset, the tags are automatically recorded along with the analytics data.</p>

  <p class="p">To use custom analytics, it must be enabled for your account. Once enabled, you set it up through the <span class="ph">Backlot API</span>, embed client code that records the custom analytics, and view the output through the <span class="ph">Backlot API</span> or <span class="ph">Backlot UI</span>. </p>

  
  <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
   For information about adding custom analytics to your account, contact Sales, your Customer Success Manager, or Technical Support.
