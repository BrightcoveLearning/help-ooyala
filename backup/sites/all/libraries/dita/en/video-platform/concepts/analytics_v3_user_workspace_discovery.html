            <span class="ph">Discovery</span> Clickthrough Rate (CTR)
            measures the effectiveness of <span class="ph">Discovery</span> recommendations by capturing how many times the

            defined as the ratio of the number of clicks on <span class="ph">Discovery</span> screens to the number of
            impressions of <span class="ph">Discovery</span> screens. For example, if the <span class="ph">Discovery</span> screen is shown 100

            total number of organic plays. An organic play is a video having been played by the user
            from any content carousel on the site except a <span class="ph">Discovery</span> screen.
            For example, if the number of organic plays is 100 and <span class="ph">Discovery</span>
            brought an additional 15 plays, that would be a <span class="ph">Discovery</span> Lift
            of 15%.

            plays. For example, If the view time from the 100 organic plays in a week was 200
