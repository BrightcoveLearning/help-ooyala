    <div class="section" id="ingestion_mrss__mrss_about"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">About MRSS</h2>Media RSS (MRSS) is an extension of RSS that allows you to syndicate multimedia files in RSS feeds. For technical details, see the <a class="xref" href="http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss" target="_blank">Media RSS Specification</a>.
   </div>


   <div class="section" id="ingestion_mrss__mrss_setup"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Setting Up MRSS</h2>
      Contact your Ooyala representative and indicate that you want to use MRSS. For each video you want to ingest, you must provide Ooyala with valid content URLs. URLs can include <samp class="ph codeph">http://</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">https://</samp>.
    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Using MRSS</h2> To use MRSS, you host metadata and/or videos and other files
         (thumbnails, closed captions) on a web server, and create an XML manifest file that
         references that content. <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Using MRSS to Pull Metadata Only</strong></p>
<ol class="ol">
            <li class="li">Create an XML manifest file as described in <a class="xref" href="../tasks/ingestion_ftp_xml.html" title="When ingesting videos, you can use XML manifest files to specify extra metadata (including the video title, description, flight times, labels, and custom metadata), as well as thumbnail and closed caption files. You can use XML manifest files when you ingest content with FTP, Aspera, or MRSS.">XML Manifest File</a>. You must use
               the <samp class="ph codeph">ooyala:remoteasset</samp> tag for metadata-only ingestion. </li>

            <li class="li">Host the XML manifest file on one of the MRSS locations you provided. Make sure that
               the filename and path matches exactly one of the paths you provided to Ooyala.</li>

         </ol>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Using MRSS to Pull Videos, Thumbnails, and Closed Caption Files</strong></p>
<ol class="ol">
            <li class="li">Host one or more files (videos, thumbnails, and closed caption files) on a web
               server.</li>

            <li class="li">Create an XML manifest file (see <a class="xref" href="../tasks/ingestion_ftp_xml.html" title="When ingesting videos, you can use XML manifest files to specify extra metadata (including the video title, description, flight times, labels, and custom metadata), as well as thumbnail and closed caption files. You can use XML manifest files when you ingest content with FTP, Aspera, or MRSS.">XML Manifest File</a>). Make sure that the entries in the file reference the
               files on your server. In particular, the value of the
                  <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;media:content&gt;</samp> element's <samp class="ph codeph">href</samp>
               attribute <em class="ph i">must</em> be an HTTP URL to the file on your server, as in the following
               example:
               <pre class="pre">&lt;media:content url="http://mysite.com/upload/lacrosse_70.mov" /&gt;</pre>
</li>

            <li class="li">Host the XML manifest file on one of the MRSS locations you provided. Make sure that
               the filename and path exactly matches one of the paths you provided to Ooyala. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
                  Unfortunately, the concept of "client logging" does not apply to MRSS feed-based
                  processing. The best way to verify that your feed is processing successfully is to
                  check for the appearance of your assets, either with the Backlot UI or the Backlot
                  API <samp class="ph codeph">/v2/assets</samp> request. </div>
</li>

         </ol>
After the videos and any other associated files are processed, to pull more files, you
         simply host another MRSS file in the agreed-upon location. </div>

    
      <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Validating MRSS Feeds</h2>
         You can use the following feed
         validator to validate the MRSS feeds you create: <span class="ph">Ooyala <a class="xref" href="../../../../../../../feed_validator.html" target="_blank">MRSS Feed Validator</a></span>.
        </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Validating Closed Captions</h2>Use the <span class="ph">Ooyala <a class="xref" href="../../../../../../../ttml_validator.html" target="_blank">Closed Captions Validator</a></span> to check your DFXP/TTML documents for your convenience.
            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> We provide Ooyala-specific DFXP support. Even if you follow the w3c document
            definition for DFXP/TTML, it may not be supported. If you run into any issues with your
            DFXP/TTML files, contact your Ooyala support representative.</div>
