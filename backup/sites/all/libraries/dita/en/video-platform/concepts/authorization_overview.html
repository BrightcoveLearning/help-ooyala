    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">Publishers use playback authorization to ensure that videos can be played only from an
            authorized account. The <a class="xref" href="player_v3dev_authoverview.html">Ooyala Player Token</a> helps ensure that only authorized viewers
            can view content. For instance, viewers are prevented from sharing content with friends
            who don’t have accounts. In addition, Ooyala is integrated with <a class="xref" href="adobepass_integration.html">Adobe Pass</a> so
            American Pay TV subscribers can get access to online versions of their favorite
            channels.</p>

        <p class="p">Concurrent stream limits let publishers limit the number of simultaneous streams being
      played by one particular user account. This protects a publisher’s revenue streams by limiting
      paying subscribers who share login information with friends. It also meets stringent studio
      license agreements that specify concurrent stream limit enforcement in addition to using
      industry-accepted DRM technologies.</p>

<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../api/player_v4_authorization_api.html">Player Authorization API for Player V4</a></strong><br/>
The Authorization API request is a key element in Ooyala's content protection features.     This topic refers to Player V4.</li>

<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="player_v3_concurrent_stream_limits.html">Limiting Concurrent Streams per Viewer</a></strong><br/>
 By default, your Ooyala Backlot provider account limits each viewer account to 2     concurrent streams. This feature discourages viewers from sharing their credentials with friends     who don’t have accounts. If the viewer, or someone with their account credentials, tries to open     an additional stream while the maximum number of streams is open, the player displays a message     and refuses to open the stream. This default limit applies across all of the syndication groups     (aka publishing rules) within your provider account.  You change this limit, and you can enable     or disable the limit on a per-group basis. You can also enable or disable this setting for the     default group. You can change your Ooyala Backlot provider account limit. You can also set this     type of limit <em class="ph i">at the asset level</em>. For example, your provider account limit could be 3,     and your asset-level limit could be 1. In this case, three friends or family members could log     in using the same credentials and watch three different assets concurrently, but would be     blocked from watching any particular asset concurrently.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="player_v3_category_limits.html">Enforcing Per-Studio Limits on Concurrent Streams</a></strong><br/>
The Category API allows you to group assets into categories according to the concurrent     stream limits required by a studio or other content owner. A concurrent stream limit is the     maximum number of unique movie titles a user can watch simultaneously. You create a category for     a studio, set the limit of concurrent streams allowed by that studio, then assign specific     assets to the category. Actions taken on categories do not change any of the attributes     associated with the assets within the category, it only changes their categorization. Use the     Backlot API to work with categories of movies. Use the Rights Locker API to set limits on the     categories for a specific user. All category routes are authenicated prior to allowing     access.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="player_v3_stop_stream.html">Stopping Unauthorized Streams</a></strong><br/>
Your Ooyala Backlot provider account can be configured to allow you to stop     unauthorized streaming in realtime. Then, to stop unauthorized access to an asset as it is     streaming, use Rights Locker to delete the entitlement or contact your Ooyala Customer Support     Manager to do it for you. The deletion of the entitlement causes stream takedown to occur     immediately.</li>
