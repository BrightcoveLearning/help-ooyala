<h1 class="title topictitle1">Enforcing Per-Studio Limits on Concurrent Streams</h1>

  
  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Category API allows you to group assets into categories according to the concurrent
    stream limits required by a studio or other content owner. A concurrent stream limit is the
    maximum number of unique movie titles a user can watch simultaneously. You create a category for
    a studio, set the limit of concurrent streams allowed by that studio, then assign specific
    assets to the category. Actions taken on categories do not change any of the attributes
    associated with the assets within the category, it only changes their categorization. Use the
    Backlot API to work with categories of movies. Use the Rights Locker API to set limits on the
    categories for a specific user. All category routes are authenicated prior to allowing
    access.</p>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">How Types of Limits Interact</h2>
      <p class="p">The concurrent stream limit for a studio is a limit on the number of unique movie titles
        belonging to that studio (category) that a user can watch at a given time. This is different
        from the concurrent stream limit that you specify globally for your provider account, per
        viewer or per asset as described in <a class="xref" href="player_v3_concurrent_stream_limits.html" title="By default, your Ooyala Backlot provider account limits each viewer account to 2 concurrent streams. This feature discourages viewers from sharing their credentials with friends who don’t have accounts. If the viewer, or someone with their account credentials, tries to open an additional stream while the maximum number of streams is open, the player displays a message and refuses to open the stream. This default limit applies across all of the syndication groups (aka publishing rules) within your provider account. You change this limit, and you can enable or disable the limit on a per-group basis. You can also enable or disable this setting for the default group. You can change your Ooyala Backlot provider account limit. You can also set this type of limit at the asset level. For example, your provider account limit could be 3, and your asset-level limit could be 1. In this case, three friends or family members could log in using the same credentials and watch three different assets concurrently, but would be blocked from watching any particular asset concurrently.">Limiting Concurrent Streams per Viewer</a>.
        The limit for a studio takes precedence over the other types of limits, but only within the
        other limits.</p>

        <p class="p">For example, suppose you have set your provider account to a global limit of 3 movies.
        This means none of your viewers can watch more than 3 movies at once. Then you add 2
        categories, one for each studio you are working with:</p>
<ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">Studio DEF - <em class="ph i">Supermovie A</em>, <em class="ph i">Supermovie B</em>, <em class="ph i">Supermovie C</em></li>

        <li class="li">Studio XYZ - <em class="ph i">Ooyala Movie 1</em>, <em class="ph i">Ooyala Movie 2</em>, <em class="ph i">Ooyala Movie 3</em></li>

      </ul>
<p class="p">Suppose you set both studio limits at 2 titles. When the studio limit of 2 is combined with the
        provider limit of 3, the result is each user can watch up to 3 streams at a time, out of
        which only 2 titles can be from the same studio. When watching more than 2 titles, one title
        must be from the other studio. So, a user cannot watch <em class="ph i">Ooyala Movie 1</em>, <em class="ph i">Ooyala
          Movie 2</em> and <em class="ph i">Ooyala Movie 3</em> at the same time because it would breach the studio
        limit of 2 titles for Studio XYZ, even though the total number of video streams is under the
        provider limit of 3.</p>

      <p class="p">A user can watch <em class="ph i">Supermovie A</em> on 3 different streams without exceeding any limit
        because it is only one title. Similarly a user can watch <em class="ph i">Ooyala Movie 1</em>, <em class="ph i">Ooyala
          Movie 3</em>, plus another <em class="ph i">Ooyala Movie 3</em> on another stream because this does not
        breach the limit of 2 titles for Studio XYZ. In this case the viewer is watching only 2
        titles in total, with 1 title being repeated on 2 different streams. This also does not
        breach your provider limit of 3 streams.</p>

      <p class="p">Likewise, a user can watch <em class="ph i">Supermovie A</em>, <em class="ph i">Supermovie B</em> and <em class="ph i">Ooyala Movie
          1</em> at the same time because this is within your global provider limit of 3 streams and
        also within the limit of 2 movie titles per studio. In this case the user is watching 2
        titles from Studio DEF and just 1 title from Studio XYZ.</p>
