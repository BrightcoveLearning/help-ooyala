  <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Ooyala Player V3 is deprecated and is scheduled
    to be <em class="ph i">disabled</em> on 2018-01-31. After that date, Player V3 will no longer play your video
    or audio content. Customers still using Player V3 need to migrate to Player V4 (see <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_v3.html">Migrating from Player V3</a> and <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_faq.html">Player Migration FAQ</a>).</div>

  <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This section applies to both the HTML5 Player V3 and the Flash Player V3.</div>

  <p class="p">This section provides quickstart tutorials with advanced Player JavaScript examples. For a more
   basic tutorial, see <a class="xref" href="../reference/player_v3_dev_tutorial.html#player_v3_dev_tutorial" title="Use this tutorial to get started using the HTML5 Player V3.">Basic Tutorial for the HTML5 Player V3 (Deprecated)</a>.</p>

   from the Player V3 API. You will learn how to load and initialize your player, use advanced
   layout techniques, listen for events and handle errors, create robust controls, and use powerful
