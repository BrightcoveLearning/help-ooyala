 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Now that you’ve uploaded and watched your video, you are probably asking “What next?”</p>

  
  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Design and Layout</h2>
   
   <p class="p">You can control the look and feel of how your content is displayed within the Ooyala Player. For example, you might want to create a basic player that has your watermark and custom colors. Or, you might want to have your developers create a custom player from scratch. For information about creating a basic player, see <a class="xref" href="chapter_players.html" title="Describes how to create and configure Ooyala players using the Backlot UI.">Managing Players in Backlot</a>. For information about creating an advanced player, see <a class="xref" href="book_player_dg.html" title="You can customize your Player using query parameters and JavaScript-based APIs in your web pages.">Player Developer Guide</a>.</p>

   <ul class="ul">
    <li class="li"><p class="p">Grouping Content—you can group video together in channels and collections of channels in channel sets. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="chapter_channels_channelsets.html" title="Channels and channel sets let you group your content for delivery to your customers.">Channels and Channel Sets (Deprecated)</a>.</p>
</li>

    <li class="li"><p class="p">Embedding—Although you already embedded a video, you might want to automate the process. To do so, use syndication and labels. Syndications are structured lists of content that computers can easily process. Labels are tags that you assign to videos that help organize them and that can be used to add them to syndications. Once set up, one of your developers can create code to automatically embed videos from specified syndications. For information about syndications, see <a class="xref" href="chapter_syndication.html" title="Syndication enables you to externally publish your content to third-party sites such as Facebook, Boxee, YouTube, Roku, iTunes, and others.">Syndication</a>.</p>
<p class="p">For information about labels, see <a class="xref" href="chapter_labels.html" title="When added to external publishing targets, labels specify which videos, channels, and channel sets to publish externally.">Labels</a>. For information on manually embedding videos, see <a class="xref" href="chapter_publishing_manual.html" title="The most common way to publish content is to copy the HTML embed code to a web page.">Manual Publishing</a>.</p>
