  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">About Flash Player V3</h2>
   <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Ooyala Player V3 is deprecated and is scheduled
    to be <em class="ph i">disabled</em> on 2018-01-31. After that date, Player V3 will no longer play your video
    or audio content. Customers still using Player V3 need to migrate to Player V4 (see <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_v3.html">Migrating from Player V3</a> and <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_faq.html">Player Migration FAQ</a>).</div>

   
   
   <p class="p">Flash is a platform developed by Adobe that enables multimedia, animation, and video to be
    displayed on computers and devices that run the Flash player. Because the Flash player supports
    content protection technologies and a richer set of features than HTML5, it is the default
    player for devices that support it. When Flash is not available, the player will now default to
    html5-fallback (if available). This default is automatic unless you change the default behavior
    via the Player API or through a Backlot setting. </p>

    <div class="p">For more information about setting the Flash player as a default and using the
    Flash player on different devices, see the following topics: <ul class="ul">
     <li class="li">In Backlot: <a class="xref" href="../tasks/gsg_publishingvideo.html" title="Ooyala supports numerous ways to publish content. You can syndicate your content and publish it externally to third-party sites (such as YouTube or other sites), or you can publish it manually by embedding the video on a web page.">Publishing a Video</a> You can select either HTML or Flash
      embeds and apply them to a default or custom player.</li>
