            <p class="p">Integrate DFP or Ooyala Pulse with Ooyala live for seamless server-side ad insertion
                (SSAI).</p>

        
        <p class="p"><span class="ph" id="liveplatform_pulse_integeration__live_ssai_intro_paragraph">Ooyala Live offers integration with Google’s DFP and
                    Ooyala Pulse to enable SSAI. Your Ooyala representative will onboard your Pulse
                    account and integrate it with your Live account, which will have exclusive
                    access to theAd server account. Your ads will be automatically downloaded and
                    transcoded. </span></p>

        <div class="note note" id="liveplatform_pulse_integeration__live_ssai_intro_note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This capability supports only HTTP Live Streaming (HLS ).
            Therefore, when you create your channel, use an HLS output template. </div>

        <p class="p">With <dfn class="term">Personalized SSAI</dfn>, the ad server customizes the ads it displays to each
                individual user. Different users might get the same set of ads in the same order,
                but the decisions are still made individually for each user.</p>

        <p class="p">When you create a channel for a personalized ad (personalized for users), you must create
            a publishing rule called SSAI in your Backlot account (see <a class="xref" href="../tasks/publishing_rules_create.html#publishing_rules_create" title="You can create as many publishing rules as you like and assign them to videos, channels, or channel sets. During playback, the most restrictive rule as applied.">Creating Publishing Rules</a>).</p>

        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> You should use Ooyala Player V4, which supports playback in HLS. Ooyala Player V3 does
                not support HLS on the web. </div>

            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p">Before you create a channel, make sure at least one ad slate has been added to the
                Live account:</p>

                    <li class="li">If no slates have the <span class="ph uicontrol">Ad Slate</span> field checked, add an
                        ad slate, which must be an MP4 video at least 5 seconds long, and cannot be
                        an image.</li>

                </ul>
</div>

        <p class="p">To integrate Pulse ads in your live stream, follow these steps in the Ooyala Live UI:</p>

                <li class="li">Create a channel - go to Channels, click Add Channel and go through the

While going through the channel creation process, if
                                you are on-boarded with at least one ad provider, an Ad Setup page
                                will be displayed. If you cannot choose your ad provider, it may be
                                due to an incompatible elemental-live encoding output profile. If
                                this is the case, you should see list of detected issues on the
                                screen. You will either need to choose a compatible profile or
                                correct the current one before you proceed. </li>
