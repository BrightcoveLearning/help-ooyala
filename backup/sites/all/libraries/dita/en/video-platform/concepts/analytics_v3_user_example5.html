            <p class="p">The number of plays you get throughout a day varies a great deal with time of day and
                across time periods. You need a quick snapshot of the best performing videos and
                videos which are not in your radar but should be noticed. </p>

            <p class="p">Are there trends in performance? Do they consistently appear at the same time of day?
                How can I get an overview of the performance of all the videos in my portfolio, to
                get a sense of the standout anomalies? What additional information can you uncover
                about that video?</p>

                <li class="li">Point out a trending video that is not the most popular (a video that is top
                    content).</li>

                <li class="li"> Click on the video from the Trending Past Hour panel. This will take you to the
                    Video Details view for the video. </li>

                <li class="li">Review the Device tab at the bottom of the Video Details page. <p class="p">This shows
                        that the video was viewed on mobile devices much more than on desktop. You
                        may wish to elevate the visibility of the video on the mobile site while
                        leaving it alone on the desktop site.</p>

                </li>

                <li class="li">Review the Geography tab at the bottom of the Video Details page. <p class="p">This shows
                        that the video was not played often in the US but received a significant
                        number of plays in the UK. You may wish to make modifications to your UK
                        website to elevate the prominence of the video asset, but leave the asset
                        where it was on the US website.</p>
