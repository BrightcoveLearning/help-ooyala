    <div class="body conbody">
        <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> This topic contains older information and has been deprecated. For the
        latest information about Ooyala integration with Chromecast, see <a class="xref" href="chromecast/index.html">Chromecast Integration</a>.</div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Receiver Application</h2>
            
            <p class="p">The receiver application is an HTML5/JavaScript application that runs on the
                Chromecast device. The receiver application performs the following functions:</p>

            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Provides a user interface to display the app's content on the TV screen.</li>

                <li class="li">Handles messages from the sender application to control content on the receiver
                    device.</li>

                <li class="li">Handles custom messages from the sender application that are
                    application-specific.</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="p">The Receiver application framework:</p>

            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Integrates with <a class="xref" href="https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/custom_receiver" target="_blank">Google's Receiver SDK</a> , which builds and enables the
                    receiver application page.</li>

                <li class="li">Integrates with Ooyala V3 HTML5 player.</li>

                <li class="li">Integrates with Google’s <a class="xref" href="https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/player" target="_blank">Media Player Library</a> , which is Google's code for
                    media/video playback.</li>

                <li class="li">Establishes communication with the Sender application via Google Custom
                    Channel.</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="p">We offer two sample receivers that you can get started with: the default receiver and
                the custom receiver.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Default Receiver</h2>
              
            <p class="p">The default receiver application contains simplified code with playback capabilities
                and styling abstracted from the Receiver app. This receiver allows for quick and
                easy implementation for testing purposes, and so on. Use this receiver if you don’t
                want to make complicated customizations to the receiver UI. You can only customize
                logos and icons in the default receiver UI.</p>

            <p class="p">This receiver is recommended for customers who need:</p>

            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Quick launch timelines.</li>

                <li class="li">Low cost of operation and low maintenance.</li>

                <li class="li">Basic Chromecast functionality without custom work.</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="p">The sample default receiver is now open source. Go to <a class="xref" href="https://github.com/ooyala/chromecast-sample-receiver" target="_blank">https://github.com/ooyala/chromecast-sample-receiver</a> and open receiver_default.html.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Custom Receiver</h2>
            
            <p class="p">The custom receiver application interacts with the Cast Receiver Library and is more
                verbose to allow for rich customization. The custom receiver UI can be used “as-is”
                or can be customized. Use a <a class="xref" href="http://community.ooyala.com/t5/Developers-Knowledge-Base/Implementing-a-Chromeless-Player/ta-p/1055" target="_blank">chromeless player</a> and build your own UI on
                top of the custom receiver and/or customize playback capabilities. </p>

            <p class="p">This receiver is recommended for customers:</p>

            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Need flexible framework for implementing custom Chromecast capabilities.</li>

                <li class="li">Have strict business requirements for product branding, styling and UX.</li>

                <li class="li">Have access to development resources for implementing custom requirements and
                    continued maintenance.</li>

                <li class="li">Need to build additional functionality(Sender and Receiver) on top of what is
                    already provided.</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="p">The sample custom receiver is now open source. Go to <a class="xref" href="https://github.com/ooyala/chromecast-sample-receiver" target="_blank">https://github.com/ooyala/chromecast-sample-receiver</a> and open receiver_custom.html.</p>
