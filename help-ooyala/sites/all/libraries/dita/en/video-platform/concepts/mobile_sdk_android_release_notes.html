            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">React Native update to 0.59.4</strong></p>
                    <p class="p">Android is requiring apps built for 64 bit compatibility by August 1, 2019 (new apps): <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/01/get-your-apps-ready-for-64-bit.html">https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/01/get-your-apps-ready-for-64-bit.html</a>.</p>

                    <p class="p">Starting from 0.59, React Native is 64 bit. Therefore, to allow our customers to have 64-bit support, we upgraded our React Native version in our SDKs to version 0.59.4.</p>

                </li>
                <li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Chapter Markers</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                    <p class="p">Markers are graphical objects superimposed over the Ooyala timeline. Markers are used to display a variety of metadata about a file:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Instantaneous events can be displayed. In this case, the length of the timeline marker is determined by the player, and is designed to be the minimal width that is easily seen and clickable.</li>
                        <li>Timed duration events can be displayed. In this case, the metadata displays the marker on the timeline for the given duration.</li>
                        <li>Timed duration events can be displayed. In this case, the metadata displays the marker on the timeline for the given duration.</li>
                        <li>The timing of markers can be defined with respect to the beginning or end of the timeline to show the duration of the identified event duration (beginning and end).</li>
                        <li>The Marker JSON file can be ingested prior to playback and/or updated via player API at any time, similar to a Closed Caption file. The timeline marker will also be delivered to the player via the Content Tree API.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Behavior</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>By clicking on a marker container (above the timeline), the playhead will jump to the defined start time for the marker. </li>
                        <li>If the user clicks on the highlighted marker area on the timeline itself, it will move the playhead to that exact point, rather than to the beginning of the chapter marker. That is, the timeline marker will behave as it does normally, with or without Chapter Markers.</li>
                        <li>If the user does a hover (or other) even that invokes the scrubber thumbnails, these thumbnails will appear on top of the scrubber thumbnails - they have visual priority over the chapter markers above the timeline.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="p">For more on how to utilize Chapter Markers, please see <a href="https://docs.brightcove.com/apidocs-ooyala/concepts/chapter-markers.html">Chapter Markers</a>.</p>

                </li>

                <li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Chromecast button in Ooyala Skin SDKs</strong></p>
                    <p class="p">This is the most requested feature for Ooyalar applications. Users need to be able to access the Chromecast controls within the video player itself from Skin SDK. </p>

                    <p class="p">To use this feature in your application, make sure dependencies are added in <code>build.gradle</code>:</p>
<pre><code>dependencies {
    ...
        implementation files('libs/OoyalaSDK.aar')
        implementation files('libs/OoyalaCastSDK.aar')
        implementation files('libs/OoyalaSkinSDK.aar')
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you don’t want to use cast  make sure that you don't add dependencies in <code>build.gradle</code>.</p>
<p>By default <code>castControls</code> in <code>skin.json</code> are disabled so it necessary to turn the on in <code>skin.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code>"castControls": {
    "enabled":true,
    ....
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this section of skin.json it also possible to manage the style of cast controls and what controls should be shown.</p>
<p>More details can be found in ChromecastSampleApp provided to show the basic implementation.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="li">
                  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Recycler View Support</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>RecyclerView Sample App</strong></p>
                  <p class="p">A new sample app shows how we currently support the OoyalaPlayer in a RecyclerView. The name of the app is misleading since it is called FullscreenSampleApp, but it only shows how to add OoyalaPlayers as items in a RecyclerView.</p>

                  <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Android Studio 2.3.2 or above</li>
                    <li>Android SDK installed</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
                  <p class="p">The main idea is to use only one instance of Ooyala player (SinglePlayerActivity) or several instances of Ooyala player (MultiplePlayerActivity) and reuse it when onBind is called in Adapter.</p>
                  <p class="p">OoyalaSkinLayout is initialized only once, the parent Frame layout adds OoyalaSkinLayout once the next item of RecyclerView is seen and removes it when scrolling reveals another video.</p>
                  <p class="p">In the sample app, multiple players should be embedded and perform the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>As the user scrolls, the video autoplays when the player is fully in view.</li>
                  <li>Once scrolling continues, that player should be automatically paused.</li>
                  <li>Once scrolling reveals another player and scrolling stops, playback should be automatically started.</li>
                  <li>If the user pauses the video, the video will be paused.</li>
                  <li>Once scrolling reveals the player with the video that was paused by the user, the video won't play automatically.</li>
                  <li>The playhead time is saved for each video and each video starts from the time it was paused.</li>
                  <li>If the user unmutes any video player, all future videos should start up unmuted.</li>
                  <li>Embedded container should use most of the screen when viewed vertically, except for a header taking up some space title "Video Feed Sample App". Video embeds are separated by the text of the video title centered inline on the video list.</li>
                  <li>If the user moves the device to view horizontally while a video is being played, it automatically goes full-screen on the video.</li>
                  <li>If the user returns to portrait mode, the video becomes viewed as embedded in video list again.</li>
                  <li>If a video is not playing while viewed horizontally, then the list is expanded to full width.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Activities</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><code>MainActivity</code></li>
                  <li><code>SinglePlayerActivity</code> demonstrates how to use <code>RecyclerView</code> with the only one instance of <code>OoyalaPlayer</code></li>
                  <li><code>MultiplePlayerActivity</code> demonstrates how to use <code>RecyclerView</code> with several reusable instances of <code>OoyalaPlayer</code></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
                <p class="p">In <code>skin.json</code> the following fields have to be set as shown below:</p>
<pre><code>"endScreen": {
  "screenToShowOnEnd": "default",
  "showReplayButton": true,
  "replayIconStyle": {
    "color": "white",
    "opacity": 1
  },
  "showTitle": false,
  "showDescription": false,
  "infoPanelPosition": "topLeft"
  }

  "upNext": {
    "showUpNext": false,
    "timeToShow": 10
}
</code></pre>

                    <p class="p">In this release, we have introduced a new DASH/HLS Downloader, which is based on the ExoPlayer downloader. This is in addition to the original Ooyala Android SDK DASH-only downloader that was available in previous releases. Both downloaders will be maintained in the near future, but due to the additional capabilities of the ExoPlayer-based downloader, we may deprecate the original downloader in future SDK versions.</p>

                    <p class="p">These two downloaders are:</p>

                    <ul class="ul">

                    <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> For a demonstration on how the two downloaders work, try the <a class="xref" href="https://github.com/ooyala/android-sample-apps/tree/stable/PlaybackLab/DownloadToOwnSampleApp" target="_blank">Ooyala DownloadToOwnSampleApp</a> sample app. Check <a class="xref" href="https://github.com/ooyala/android-sample-apps/blob/stable/PlaybackLab/DownloadToOwnSampleApp/app/src/main/java/com/ooyala/sample/players/OfflineDownloadActivity.java" target="_blank">OfflineDownloadActivity</a> for the original <em class="ph i">DashDownloader</em> downloader, and <a class="xref" href="https://github.com/ooyala/android-sample-apps/blob/stable/PlaybackLab/DownloadToOwnSampleApp/app/src/main/java/com/ooyala/sample/players/OoyalaOfflineDownloadActivity.java" target="_blank">OoyalaOfflineDownloadActivity</a> for the new <em class="ph i">OoyalaDownloader</em> downloader based on ExoPlayer.</div>

                    <p class="p">This new functionality in OoyalaDownloader enables you to perform the following actions:</p>

                    <p class="p">In this release, we have introduced support for audio-only streaming.</p>

                    <p class="p">To set up an Ooyala Player for Audio-Only streaming, ensure that the Player is configured to only use audio-only content - no video (including slates) should be present in streams for audio-only use.</p>

                    <p class="p">For a demonstration of this feature, please see our sample application on the following link, and refer to the configuration notes below:</p>

                    <p class="p">In this Ooyala Android sample application bundle, you must also add the new <samp class="ph codeph">setAudioOnly(true)</samp> option to the <samp class="ph codeph">createPlayerOptions()</samp> method in the <span class="ph filepath">AudioOnlyPlayerActivity.java</span> file (located under <span class="ph filepath">/OoyalaSkinSampleApp/app/src/main/java/com/ooyala/sample/players/</span>):</p>

                    <p class="p">In this release we have introduced the option to define a custom initial bitrate for ExoPlayer using the new <samp class="ph codeph">setBitrateEstimate</samp> method. This feature enables you to configure the Player to start with an initial bitrate that is higher than the first bitrate in the manifest (typically the lowest bitrate). When you provide a value for <samp class="ph codeph">setBitrateEstimate</samp>, the ExoPlayer’s ABR logic adapts the initial bitrate estimate setting accordingly, similar to what it would normally do via measuring the network speed.</p>

                    <p class="p">The other new method, <samp class="ph codeph">getBitrateEstimate</samp>, enables you to check the current bitrate estimate setting.</p>

                    <p class="p">Quick configuration steps follow below. For more information, please see our API documentation for <samp class="ph codeph">setBitrateEstimate</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">getBitrateEstimate</samp> methods <a class="xref" href="https://docs.brightcove.com/apidocs-ooyala/android_mobilesdk/classcom_1_1ooyala_1_1android_1_1_ooyala_player.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                    <p class="p">To set the initial bitrate estimate:</p>

                    the video can hang.</li>

                <li class="li">After playing a midroll ad, the <samp class="ph codeph">seekCompleted</samp> event from the
                    player gets disabled in the same playback session.</li>

                <li class="li">When setting up multiple IMA Non Ad Rules ads in a video, after playing the

                <li class="li">Added a sample that shows how to use the scrubber bar when the player is inside
