    <div class="body conbody">
    <div class="section">
    <p class="p">The Ooyala IQ Date Range Comparison functionality allows you to easily add a comparison date
                range on the Business Intelligence page to see how user engagement has changed. For
                example, you can find insights like:</p>

    <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">How does last week compare to the week before it?</li>

        <li class="li">How does September this year compare to September last year?</li>

        <li class="li">How does a time-bound sport event compare to another sport event that happened some time
                    ago?</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="p">To add a comparison date range, click the <span class="ph uicontrol">Add comparison date range</span>
                button next to the selected date period. By default, the most recent previous period
                is selected. You can customize the comparison period by clicking the comparison date
                range to set another start date. The end date is calculated automatically based on
                the length of the selected period.</p>

    <div class="p"><div class="fig fignone">
        <img class="image" src="../image/analytics_v3_comparison_time_picker.png" height="534" width="1280"/>
    </div>
</div>

        <p class="p">Once a comparison period has been added, the Ooyala IQ Business Intelligence page updates
                to include several comparisons.</p>

        <div class="p"><div class="fig fignone">
            <img class="image" src="../image/analytics_v3_comparison_time_series_card.png" height="468" width="1280"/>
        </div>
</div>

        <p class="p">The time series card is updated to include the total change in the left side column. You
                can also see comparisons with dashed lines throughout the time series. To isolate a
                metric, hover over it on the left-hand side of the view.</p>

        <div class="p"><div class="fig fignone">
            <img class="image" src="../image/analytics_v3_comparison_isolate_metric.png" height="302" width="819"/>
        </div>
</div>

        <p class="p">The asset card is also updated to include comparisons. Please note that only assets that were active during the full period (including the comparison period) will have comparisons added. This logic was implemented to avoid cases where there is massive uplift because the asset was not active for the full comparison period.</p>

        <p class="p">The bottom four cards for device, geography, player and traffic source are also updated to include comparisons.</p>

        <div class="p"><div class="fig fignone">
            <img class="image" src="../image/analytics_v3_comparison_bottom_cards.png" height="1478" width="3888"/>
        </div>
</div>

        <p class="p">Comparisons are made as percentages since it is sometimes difficult to quickly find the difference of two very large numbers. You can, however, hover the percentages throughout the user interface to get the actual number.</p>

        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <strong class="ph b">Important:</strong> The date compare feature is not available in the Ooyala IQ API. You will have to either include the full date range or make two separate requests, combine the results and calculate the change.</div>
