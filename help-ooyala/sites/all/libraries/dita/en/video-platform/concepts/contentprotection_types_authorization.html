  <div class="body conbody">
     <div class="section">
       
     <p class="p">Playback authorization, which includes token-based authentication, is an additional security
        layer on top of protected streaming. This category is broad and encompasses many different
        technologies.</p>

     </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Token-based Authentication</h2>
      
 
   <p class="p">Token-based authentication, required for RTMPE, ensures that encrypted content cannot be
      downloaded until the client has been verified and prevents content from being played in a
      non-Ooyala player. There are several kinds of token-based authentication.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Ooyala Playback Token</h2>
      
      The Ooyala Playback Token, which in general is for authenticating users, is foundational in many of Ooyala's content protection features.  See details in
      <a class="xref" href="player_v3dev_authoverview.html#player_v3_dev_bitbuff">Ooyala Player Token for Player V3 (Deprecated)</a>,
      including integrating with the iOS and Android SDKs from Ooyala.
      (Available only if your Ooyala account includes this functionality. To enable Ooyala Player Token, contact your account manager.)
    </div>
    
     <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">
          CDN Token
        </h2>
        <p class="p">The purpose of the so-called "CDN token" is to
          protect the content on a Content Delivery Network (CDN).</p>

     <p class="p">One example is Akamai token-based authentication. See the details in <a class="xref" href="akamai_token.html#akamaitoken" title="You do not need to write any programs to make use of this authentication.">Akamai Secure Token</a>. 
      </p>

     </div>

    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Widevine</h2>
      
      <p class="p">A composite content protection system, Widevine Modular includes playback authorization and other features.</p>

        Manager. More details on integrating with Widevine Modular are in <a class="xref" href="widevine_modular.html">Widevine Modular Content Protection</a>.</p>
