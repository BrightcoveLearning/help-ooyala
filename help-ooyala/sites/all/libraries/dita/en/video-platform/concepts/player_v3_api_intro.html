 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Welcome to the <span class="ph">Ooyala</span>
  <span class="ph">Player</span> API Reference. Ooyala offers a customizable, feature-rich
  Player used to provide a top-notch video experience across industries and across multiple devices. </p>

  <div class="section"><div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Ooyala Player V3 is deprecated and is scheduled
    to be <em class="ph i">disabled</em> on 2018-01-31. After that date, Player V3 will no longer play your video
    or audio content. Customers still using Player V3 need to migrate to Player V4 (see <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_v3.html">Migrating from Player V3</a> and <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_faq.html">Player Migration FAQ</a>).</div>

   <p class="p">As consumers leverage the freedom that mobile devices provide, they expect video to match what
    they have come to expect on their desktops and to be available across devices. Increasingly,
    HTML5 is becoming the primary and only standard for this type of mobile video experience. Ooyala
    offers the Player to make it easier to give your customers this kind of video experience. The
    following topics describe the Player APIs. </p>
