   videos to Backlot. Aspera uses encryption while transferring data.</div>
 
  
  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Account Policy</h2>Your account is limited to a maximum of 100GB on the
   ingestion server at any time. If you expect to upload more content, you can request a
   temporary increase from your Customer Success Manager or Technical Support. </div>

<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you want to use both basic and manifest-based ingestion, you need to
        create separate, uniquely-named, upload-only user accounts for each (for example,

        <samp class="ph codeph">user1_manifest@example.com</samp>).</div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Downloading the Aspera Client</h2>Aspera is available as a free browser plug-in
   or as a licensed desktop client. The Aspera browser plugin will be offered for download the first
   time a user connects to the ingest endpoint and logs in successfully. You can also download the software separately.
   <ul class="ul">
    <li class="li">To download the free browser plugin, go to <a class="xref" href="http://downloads.asperasoft.com/" target="_blank">Aspera downloads page</a> and download the Aspera Connect plugin.</li>

    <li class="li">To download the desktop client, go to <a class="xref" href="http://asperasoft.com/software/client-options/desktop-client/" target="_blank">aspera client</a>. </li>

   <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Setting VR 360 File Metadata</h2>
     <p class="p">If you are uploading a VR 360 video file, first label the file as VR 360 and tell which
        type of VR 360 it is, monoscopic or stereoscopic. Use file metadata to transmit this
        information.</p>

     <p class="p">You can set VR 360 file metadata in the manifest file (see <a class="xref" href="ingestion_fileformats.html">Manifest File Formats</a>). </p>

      <p class="p">If you are not using a manifest file, indicate the file type by setting file metadata with
        the <samp class="ph codeph">ffmpeg</samp> command-line utility.
        For example, suppose you are going to upload a Matroska (.mkv) file.
       With this type of file, you can create a custom metadata tag named 
       <samp class="ph codeph">vr360type</samp> and assign it one of the following values:
       <samp class="ph codeph">mono</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">stereo_lr</samp>.  
       For example:</p>

     <pre class="pre codeblock">ffmpeg -i inputFile.mkv -c copy -metadata "vr360type=mono" outputFile.mkv</pre>

     <p class="p">Some file formats do not support custom metadata. For example, with MP4 files,
          <samp class="ph codeph">ffmpeg</samp> allows only predefined metadata tags. As a workaround, use the
        general-purpose <samp class="ph codeph">description</samp> field with predefined values to indicate the VR
        360 file type. The value of <samp class="ph codeph">description</samp> must include the text <samp class="ph codeph">VR
          360</samp> and one of the following: <samp class="ph codeph">mono</samp> or
        <samp class="ph codeph">stereo_lr</samp>.  For example:</p>

     <pre class="pre codeblock">ffmpeg -i inputFile.mp4 -c copy -metadata "description"="VR 360 Type is mono ..."  outputFile.mp4</pre>

     <p class="p">For more information about VR 360, see 
       <a class="xref" href="vr360.html">VR 360 Videos</a>.</p>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Ingesting with the Aspera Client</h2> You can upload a video via the Aspera
   client either with or without a manifest. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> All upload files must comply with the ingest
    requirements described in <a class="xref" href="../reference/input_formats.html" title="Before uploading content to Backlot, make sure you are using a supported file format and following the best practices for source files.">Supported Ingest Formats</a></div>

    <li class="li">In a browser, enter the endpoint transfer.ooyala.com. This endpoint will work
        from all locations. You can also use a specific endpoint for your region.
        See <a class="xref" href="alternative_ftp_aspera_servers.html">Ooyala Ingest Server Endpoints</a>.</li>

    <li class="li">Log into the ingest endpoint using the credentials (email and password) of your Backlot
        user account.</li>

    <li class="li">If prompted, open the Aspera app.
        (If no prompt appears, the Aspera app is already open.)</li>
   
    <li class="li">Upload the file(s) you want to ingest (videos, thumbnails, closed caption files, and so on).
     If you are using a manifest file, be sure to upload all of the files that are referenced in the
     manifest file.</li>

    <li class="li">Ooyala suggests that you upload the manifest file last.</li>

   </ol>
 Files are deleted immediately after they are all processed. Submitted files that do not go
   through the entire ingestion workflow (for example, awaiting the upload of the manifest file) are
   deleted from the server after 7 days.</div>
