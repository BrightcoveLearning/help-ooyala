 <h1 class="title topictitle1">About Sub-accounts</h1>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Multiple <span class="ph">Backlot</span> accounts can be linked as master and
  sub-accounts.</p>

  
  <p class="p">If you have multiple accounts and want to set up sub-accounts, contact your Customer Success
   Manager.</p>

 
  <p class="p">Associating a sub-account with a master account results in the sub-account appearing in the
    <span class="ph uicontrol">ALL SOURCES</span> label. This new label contains all the content from the
   sub-account, which can be viewed in the master account. The content from the sub-account loses
   its existing label structure and appears flat in the master account.</p>

  <div class="fig fignone">
   <img class="image" src="../image/subaccounts.png"/>
  </div>

  <div class="p">Sub-account content viewed in the master account has the same embed code (content ID or asset
   ID) in the sub-account and master account. Changing the title, description, or metadata of the
   content in the master account results in these same changes in the sub-account. Videos copied
   from the master to a sub-account will have their own embed code and changes made to the copied
   asset will not affect the original asset. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> When an asset is copied to another account
    (master to sub-account or sub-account to master account), it will be considered a separate
    ingestion and transcoding charges are applicable. With every ingestion a new embed code is
    created. While the master account has access to the same videos within a sub-account and can use
    the same embed code, the sub-account is not able to see the assets that were uploaded via the
    master account or assets from another sub-account. To copy content from sub-accounts or master
    accounts to another account, please contact Brightcove Technical Support, as this process is not
    recommended.  </div>
</div>

  <p class="p">Deleting an asset from the master or sub-account results in that asset being removed from the
   other account. </p>
 
  <p class="p">The master account can view analytics data for the sub-accounts, but cannot filter the
   analytics data by sub-account. </p>

<p class="p">Publishing rules and ad settings applied in the master account are not reflected in the
   sub-accounts. An asset can and likely will have a different syndication setting or ad set in the
   master account and sub-account. For ad sets, one ad_set_id will belong to the master and another
   ad_set_id will belong to the sub-account. For syndications, one syndication_id will belong to the
   master and another syndication_id will belong to the sub-account. </p>
