        <div class="section">You can build playlists by specific video assets or by label. With playlists, you
            can control the content your viewers can access within a theme. You can also organize
            the content in the playlist. For example, you can create a western theme and have it
            contain a playlist filled with western movies, ordered by release date. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
    <ul class="ul">
      
     <li class="li">The maximum number of videos you can add to a
      playlist is 64.</li>

     <li class="li">The maximum number of labels you can associate with a playlist is
      16.</li>

     <li class="li">Allow some time for the playlist you create to be propagated through the Ooyala systems. If you are doing a demonstration, it is best to use playlists you have created previously.</li>

                    enable pods for your player, playlists are not visible to users. To make
