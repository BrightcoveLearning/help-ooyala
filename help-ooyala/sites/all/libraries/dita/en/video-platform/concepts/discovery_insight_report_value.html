    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Deriving Value From <span class="ph">Discovery Insights</span></h1>

    
    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The <span class="ph">Discovery Insights</span> information in Ooyala IQ can provide you with valuable information about your users and content. The content below describes how to derive value from the different <span class="ph">Discovery</span> metrics.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><span class="ph">Discovery</span> Clickthrough Rate (CTR)</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Click-through Rate (CTR) is probably the most important KPI you can use to measure <span class="ph">Discovery</span> impact. <span class="ph">Discovery</span> CTR measures the effectiveness of <span class="ph">Discovery</span> recommendations by capturing how many times the display of the <span class="ph">Discovery</span> screen results in additional video plays. <span class="ph">Discovery</span> CTR is defined as the ratio of the number of clicks on <span class="ph">Discovery</span> screens to the number of impressions of <span class="ph">Discovery</span> screens. For example, if the <span class="ph">Discovery</span> screen is shown 100 times and a video was selected to play 53 times, a 53% CTR is recorded.</p>

            <p class="p"><span class="ph">Discovery</span> has a default countdown of 10 seconds for its auto-play feature, but can be
                configured to have a longer or shorter countdown. The countdown timer gets suspended
                if the user ‘leans forward’ and browses through the <span class="ph">Discovery</span> end screen to select a
                different video than the first one. However, we find that the majority of consumers
                prefer to lean back and let <span class="ph">Discovery</span> play the next video for them to watch. You
                will find this reflected in the <span class="ph">Discovery</span> End Screen CTR excluding Auto-plays
                metric.</p>
    
            <p class="p">The <span class="ph">Discovery</span> End Screen Impressions metric is also provided to give you an accurate
                count (when combined with the End Screen CTR) of how many plays resulted. Based on
                the average CPM for ads on your site and your (pre-roll) ad load, you can easily
                arrive at the ad revenue impact of <span class="ph">Discovery</span>.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><span class="ph">Discovery</span> Lift</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><span class="ph">Discovery</span> Lift is a secondary KPI that helps you understand the impact of plays attributed to <span class="ph">Discovery</span> in comparison with organic plays on your site, the two adding up to become the total number of plays. An organic play is a video having been played by the user from any content carousel on the site except a <span class="ph">Discovery</span> screen.</p>
   
            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <span class="ph">Discovery</span> plays from a carousel using a <span class="ph">Discovery</span> API for recommendations are counted as organic plays, the metrics for these currently not being reported via IQ.</div>

            <p class="p"><span class="ph">Discovery</span> Lift measures the percentage increase over organic plays that <span class="ph">Discovery</span> brought to your site. For example, if the number of organic plays is 100 and <span class="ph">Discovery</span> brought an additional 15 plays, that would be a <span class="ph">Discovery</span> Lift of 15%.</p>

            <p class="p">The <span class="ph">Discovery</span> Lift may help reveal how users find and consume videos on your site. A
                site with a lot of carousels from which the user may choose a video is likely to
                have low “Lift” (and low CTR too) for each carousel (<span class="ph">Discovery</span> included), although
                <span class="ph">Discovery</span> does possess an advantage with auto-play.</p>

            <p class="p">A number of factors impact the Lift numbers, including average session length, how
                users find content (through sites that syndicate your videos or directly on your
                site, etc.), and length of videos, among others.</p>

            <p class="p">Similar to how the CTR metric is broken down by end screen (with and without auto-play) and pause screen, the <span class="ph">Discovery</span> Lift metric is broken down that way too to help understand the contribution of each <span class="ph">Discovery</span> experience element.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><span class="ph">Discovery</span> Time Lift</h2>
            
            <p class="p">We believe that a good recommendations engine drives engagement, not merely clicks. The <span class="ph">Discovery</span> Time Lift metrics add a time nuance to the <span class="ph">Discovery</span> Lift metrics. Time Lift measures the percentage increase in time spent watching videos while Lift only measures the percentage increase in play counts. In other words, Time Lift helps measure the increase in average session length.</p>

            <p class="p">For example, if 100 videos were played organically and 20 through <span class="ph">Discovery</span>, that would be a 20% Lift. However, if the time spent watching the organically-played videos was 2 minutes each and that for <span class="ph">Discovery</span>-played videos was 2.5 minutes each, then Time Lift would be (20*2.5/100*2)*100 = 40%.</p>

            <p class="p">It is quite common to see a <span class="ph">Discovery</span> Time Lift that is higher than <span class="ph">Discovery</span> Lift,
                indicating that the impact on engagement by <span class="ph">Discovery</span> was higher than the Lift
                metrics might suggest. As with Lift, a number of factors impact the Time Lift
                numbers, including average session length, how users find content (through sites
                that syndicate your videos or directly on your site, etc.), and length of videos,
                among others.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><span class="ph">Discovery</span> Plays and <span class="ph">Discovery</span> Leads</h2>
            
            <p class="p" id="discovery_insight_report_value__plays_leads_intro"><span class="ph">Discovery</span> plays and <span class="ph">Discovery</span> leads  are available per asset in the catalog, and
                measure how many times the video was played through <span class="ph">Discovery</span> and how many times
                (when played organically) it led to a <span class="ph">Discovery</span> play. </p>

            <p class="p">The <span class="ph">Discovery</span> Plays metric is easy to understand, as it counts how many times a video
                was played after a recommendation by <span class="ph">Discovery</span>. You can compare this metric against
                the IQ metric of total plays to understand the impact of, say, a <span class="ph">Discovery</span> content
                promotion for that video.</p>

            <p class="p"><span class="ph">Discovery</span> Leads can be a valuable metric to help guide your homepage editorial strategy. <span class="ph">Discovery</span> Leads measures how many times an organically played video resulted in <span class="ph">Discovery</span> plays.</p>

            <p class="p">To understand the <span class="ph">Discovery</span> Leads metric, assume that a video (Video A) is promoted on the homepage of your site. When played directly from the homepage (or other part of your site or that of your syndication partner), that would be an organic play of Video A. The <span class="ph">Discovery</span> end screen, when presented at the end of all those plays (say, N times), may result in M (M lesser than N) additional (<span class="ph">Discovery</span>) plays, this being the <span class="ph">Discovery</span> Leads metric for Video A.</p>

            <p class="p">If you see the <span class="ph">Discovery</span> Leads metric being low for a heavily promoted video, then
                the inference follows easily: Video A isn’t a great lead-in for subsequent plays.
                When you compare this metric against the other columns, you may see other such
                observations which can come in handy for editorial decisioning.</p>

            <p class="p">You can also filter the <span class="ph">Discovery</span> metrics based on the labels that you use to categorize your content in <span class="ph">Backlot</span>, or filter down to specific players, thereby opening up additional layers of engagement growth insights.</p>
