  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">About ABR</h2><p class="p"> In addition to the bitrate and buffer functions and events,
    Ooyala uses a number of heuristics to make playback as smooth as possible on every device, such
    as bandwidth estimation, content size, screen size and so forth. ABR playback (HLS,
    specifically) is preferred whenever available on the underlying devices. </p>
ABR is a technology
   that allows the Ooyala Player to adjust/change the bitrate of the stream delivered based on the
   bandwidth available to the viewer as measured over a period of time. The purpose of ABR is to
   compensate for drops or increases in bandwidth by lowering or upgrading the stream quality. The
   ABR changes to the stream quality do not happen immediately. This is not an instantaneous
   process. To make a bitrate change to the video stream, the player: <ul class="ul">
    <li class="li">Detects the change in bandwidth.</li>

    <li class="li">Waits to confirm it is permanent vs. a momentary fluctuation.</li>

    <li class="li">Sends a request to the Akamai Flash Media Server to shift to stream at the new bitrate.</li>

    <li class="li">Waits for Akamai to deliver the new bitrate stream.</li>

    <li class="li">Starts delivering the new bitrate to the viewer.</li>

   </ul>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> ABR and bitrate selection are currently mutually exclusive. You can manually set a
    bitrate, but this will override ABR.</div>
ABR takes effect only when the player has detected
   there is sufficient bandwidth available to support a higher bitrate and higher quality stream. To
   upgrade the player makes multiple checks over a period of time. If all of the checks show the
   viewer has the required bandwidth to support a higher stream, then it will upgrade. If any of the
   checks fail to show the required bandwidth, then the process is repeated. The upgrade also
   depends on the buffer length meeting a minimal threshold, and being stable or increasing.
   Dropping the bitrate of the stream being delivered is done to favor smooth and uninterrupted
   playback. Therefore, if the player sees the buffer size dropping, then it will start the process
   of downgrading the bitrate in order to have a lower bitrate stream available when the current
   buffer is exhausted. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The current Ooyala player does not support
     <samp class="ph codeph">activePanelChanged</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">ratingsApiReady</samp>, and
     <samp class="ph codeph">relatedMediaReady</samp> events. Although the <samp class="ph codeph">apiReady</samp>,
     <samp class="ph codeph">playerCreated</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">loadComplete</samp>, and
     <samp class="ph codeph">playerEmbedded</samp> events are not provided in the player, you can use the
     <samp class="ph codeph">PLAYBACK_READY</samp> Event for equivalent functionality.</div>
