 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">In v3 Analytics (<span class="ph">Ooyala IQ</span>), data are stored and presented
  multi-dimensionally.</p>

  <div class="p">
   <div class="note warning"><span class="warningtitle">Warning:</span> The v2 Analytics API has been deprecated. See <a class="xref" href="ooyala_iq_developer_guide.html">Ooyala IQ Analytics</a> for more details on the new v3 Analytics
    API.</div>

  </div>

  <p class="p">In <span class="ph">v2 Analytics</span>, the data are shown uni-dimensionally (that is, a
   single dimension). This means that in <span class="ph">v2</span> you could investigate only one
   type of data at a time; for example, by domain, or by geography, or by device, and so on.</p>

  <p class="p">In <span class="ph">v3 Analytics</span>, however, the data are presented multi-dimensionally
   (that is, more than a single dimension). What this means is that you can do analyses of more than
   one set of data at a time. For example, instead of looking at data only by geography OR by domain
   type, in <span class="ph">v3 Analytics</span> you can look at data by geography AND by domain
   (the intersection between these two dimensions). You can apply up to 3 dimension filters at a
   time.</p>

  <p class="p">In v3 Analytics (<span class="ph">Ooyala IQ</span>), multidimensional analysis is supported in
   both the GUI and the REST-based APIs.</p>
