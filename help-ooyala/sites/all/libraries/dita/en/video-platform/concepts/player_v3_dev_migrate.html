 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can migrate from your legacy players to the Ooyala player.</p>

   <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Ooyala Player V3 and V2 have been deprecated and are scheduled
    to be <em class="ph i">disabled</em> on 2018-01-31. After that date, Player V3 and Player V2 will no longer
    play your video or audio content. Customers still using older players need to migrate to Player
    V4 (see <a class="xref" href="pbv4_about.html">Player V4</a>.</div>

  <div class="section">Migrating from Player v2 to Player V3 can be fairly straightforward. This topic describes
      how to migrate your existing legacy player embed to the Ooyala Player V3 embed and event
      model. The new Ooyala Player was designed to have minimal impact on your existing set up. Â You
      can migrate your Flash player and custom modules in a fairly direct manner. <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Note</strong>:You
        can cut and paste your embed code from Backlot as you have done with prior players. If you
        use existing embed code callbacks and want to migrate to HTML5, you need to switch to using
        the message bus. Callbacks are not supported for the new embed style. They will continue to
        work for the Flash Player but not HTML5 Player. </p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Migrating from Embed Code Callbacks</strong></p>
<p class="p">If you use existing embed code callbacks
        and want to migrate to HTML5, you must switch to using the <span class="keyword parmname">OnCreate</span>
        embedded parameter. In Player V3,Callbacks are not invoked directly on the new embed style;
        instead, use the <span class="keyword parmname">OnCreate</span> parameter to specify the name of a callback
        function invoked when a player is created.</p>
