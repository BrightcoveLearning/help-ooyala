      <p class="p">The code sample includes multiple client web pages or views illustrating each feature and a
        seventh code sample that shows all the features working in combination. To implement each
        client page, you will need all the standard elements that you normally use, such as your API
        Key and pcode (for details, see <a class="xref" href="api_keys.html" title="Your Ooyala API credentials include your API key and secret, which you provide to sign HTTP requests and when using the scratchpad.">Your API Credentials</a>), and so forth. </p>

      <p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">token.php</samp> file implements Ooyala Player Token authentication content
        protection. In this Player Token sample, we use the following Player V3 APIs and
        parameters.</p>

      <ul class="ul" id="player_v3_dev_intro__ul_ghp_gly_3m">
        <li class="li"><span class="keyword apiname">OO.ready()</span> - This function indicates that the script has loaded,
          initialized completely, and that the player is ready for playback. </li>

        <li class="li"><span class="keyword apiname">OO.Player.create()</span> - This function creates a new message bus, creates
          any registered modules, and connects registered modules to the message bus. In the sample,
          you should note that <samp class="ph codeph">OO.Player.create</samp> is used with embedToken in the
          hash with the embed token url as part of the key value pair.</li>

        <li class="li"><span class="keyword apiname">platform</span> - This parameter is used to control selection of HTML5 or
          Flash playback. In the sample, it is set to Flash as the priority choice for
          playback.</li>

      </ul>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Implementing the Player Token Sample</h2>
      
      <div class="p">To implement the sample, we do the following:<ol class="ol" id="player_v3_dev_intro__ol_xsx_hs2_jm">
          <li class="li">Manually set the <strong class="ph b">Require Ooyala Player Token</strong> checkbox in Backlot. See<a class="xref" href="../tasks/player_v3dev_settoken.html" title="The Backlot UI provides you with an option to secure your content by setting a Syndication group flag adding your content assets to this syndication group. This will enable you to set up your web page to run your player(s), and send the authorization token in the form of a cookie to the browser. Follow these steps to secure your content in Backlot:">
              “Setting the Ooyala Player Token.”</a></li>

          <li class="li">Craft an authorization request using the URL token request template. See <a class="xref" href="player_v3dev_authoverview.html#player_v3_dev_bitbuff" title="Ooyala provides the ability to secure content with the Ooyala Player Token.">Ooyala Player Token</a>.</li>

          <li class="li">Create the trigger to request authorization and a token from the Ooyala authorization
            server, using the token request. See <a class="xref" href="player_v3dev_authoverview.html#player_v3_dev_bitbuff__section_eww_vc5_js">Complete Web Example: Authorize Playback and Obtain a Token</a>. </li>

          <li class="li">Generate a computed signature. You need to generate signature using an http method.
            You can use the PHP SDK or Ruby SDK to do this. The included PHP SDK has a mechanism to
            generate the signature needed by the Ooyala Player Token. (See <a class="xref" href="player_v3dev_authoverview.html#player_v3_dev_bitbuff" title="Ooyala provides the ability to secure content with the Ooyala Player Token.">Ooyala Player Token</a>). When you generate the
            signature, you will have two parameters: <ul class="ul" id="player_v3_dev_intro__ul_cbg_vsy_3m">
              <li class="li">a query parameter and</li>

              <li class="li">an HTTP method. For the Ooyala Player Token, you need to use a GET request for the
                http method.</li>

            </ul>
</li>

          <li class="li">Assemble the request and concatenate the results. </li>
