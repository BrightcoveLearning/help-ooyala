 <div class="body conbody">
  <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Theme Builder is designed to work with both Ooyala Player V4 and
        Player V3. There are some differences in the way you configure playlists for Player V4, as
        described in <a class="xref" href="pbv4_playlist.html">Using Playlists in Player V4</a>.</div>

  <p class="p">The following is a list of implementation notes for Theme Builder as of January 17, 2014</p>

  <ol class="ol">
  
   
   
   
   <li class="li">Ooyala Player Framework (OPF) modules are not loaded or active in the Theme Builder UI, but are loaded/activated when the embed is put into a web page.</li>

   
   
   <li class="li">Highlight colors do not work on all text within player.</li>

   
   
   
    <li class="li">On the <span class="ph uicontrol">Embed</span> tab, with <span class="ph uicontrol">Fluid</span> width and with
    height and width set to 0, Microsoft Internet Explorer v10 web browser does not display the
    player correctly. Other browsers work as expected. <strong class="ph b">Workaround: </strong>Set the width and height
    values of the parent <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;div&gt;</samp> container for the player on the webpage when
    rendered on IE. </li>

   
   
   
   <li class="li">On the <span class="ph uicontrol">Embed</span> tab, when the end screen is displayed, the <span class="ph uicontrol">Back to Start</span> button does not work.</li>

   
   
   
    <li class="li">For images, the suggested aspect ratio is 4:3 and suggested image dimensions are 320 pixels
    x 240 pixels. (Higher resolutions are allowed but not recommended.) Image file size limit is
    1MB.</li>

   
   
   
   <li class="li">On the <span class="ph uicontrol">Players</span> tab, The <span class="ph uicontrol">Overflow</span> setting of <span class="ph uicontrol">Paging</span> sometimes results extra, unnecessary rows when a playlist size differs form the number of rows specified.</li>

   
   
   
    <li class="li">Be careful while selecting thumbnail sizes, metadata and text sizes. Results can vary from your expectations.</li>

   
   
   
   <li class="li">If you select a player that has <span class="ph uicontrol">More Videos</span> enabled via Ooyala Backlot), on the <span class="ph uicontrol">Embed</span> tab in the Theme Builder UI, <span class="ph uicontrol">More Videos</span> is not shown. However, when the embed is put into a web page, <span class="ph uicontrol">More Videos</span> is shown.</li>

   
   
   
   <li class="li">Loading icon is displayed off-center for HTML5 player when used with playlists.</li>

   </ol>

  <div class="section" id="concept_f13_pzp_5m__tb_player_support"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Support for Flash Player V3 and HTML5 Player V3 </h2>
   You cannot apply any Theme Builder
   player customizations (color, highlight, pause screen info, etc.) to the HTML5 player.
   Specifically, the settings in the Player configuration areas headed “Settings”, “Controls” and
   “Screens” only apply to the Flash player. You apply player customizations to the v3 HTML5 player
   with CSS and JavaScript. <p class="p">However, the settings in the “Pods” section of the UI do work with
    the HTML5 Player, as do the settings for Playlists and Embed. Playlist and pod customizations,
    which are HTML5, work with both Flash and HTML5 players. </p>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">OPF Modules Not Active in Theme Builder</h2>
   
   <a class="xref" href="../reference/player_v3_dev_module.html" title="The Ooyala Player enables you to build JavaScript custom modules using our Event Model and JavaScript APIs.">Developing Custom Client Modules for HTML5 Player V3 (Deprecated)</a> modules (custom client-side
   JavaScript) defined for a video player are not active "inside" Theme Builder. This includes but
   is not limited to features such as <a class="xref" href="chapter_content_discovery.html" title="Discovery enables you to keep users engaged by directing them to related and relevant content on your site. Discovery learns continuously from video impressions and plays to provide users with a dynamic, personalized experience.">About Discovering and Recommending Content</a>. You will not see
   Discovery recommendations while you work in Theme Builder. <p class="p">Theme Builder relies a demo player
    to show the user interface effects of the design choices you make and purposefully does not
    duplicate all the features and functions of a video player in production. If you include a
    player previously configured to use OPF, you will not see those features while you are designing
    in Theme Builder. However, when your resulting <a class="xref" href="../tasks/theme_builder_embed_create.html#player_create" title="A Theme Builder embed is one or more playlists embedded within a player.">embed</a> is put into a
    production web page, all features will function fully as you expect. </p>

  </div>

  <div class="section" id="concept_f13_pzp_5m__delay"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Propagating Changes among Backlot and Theme Builder</h2>
   You might notice a slight delay
   for the changes you make in Backlot to appear in Theme Builder, or vice versa. </div>
