  <h1 class="title topictitle1">VR 360 Videos</h1>

  <div class="body conbody">
    <div class="section" id="vr360__vr360-overview">Ooyala allows you to store, publish, and play Virtual Reality (VR)
      360-degree videos for consumers wanting an immersive VR experience on mobile and desktop
      devices. Unlike traditional flat videos, VR 360 videos are created with special,
      omni-directional cameras that capture views in all directions, resulting in a "spherical"
      recording for VR interaction.</div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Considerations for VR 360 Videos</h2>When working with VR 360 videos,
      consider the following factors: <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Source File Creation</strong>: VR 360 requires special cameras to record the VR 360 content. The scope of this document assumes knowledge of how to produce and edit VR 360 content for distribution on the web and in mobile apps.
          VR 360 Streams require much more bandwidth than flat video content. </li>

        <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Specialized Requirements</strong>: VR 360 requires both rendering and framing of the VR 360-formatted stream, as well as the ability to control the camera angle. Therefore, any VR 360 video will be rendered with an additional player control capability to navigate the camera angle. In the source editing of the video, the default (zero) camera angle will be defined.</li>

        <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">VR 360 Streams require more bandwidth than flat video content.</strong> Because the viewable area on a VR 360 stream is only a small portion of the entire stream (the viewable area is typically only 10-20% of the video frame), it requires a much higher quality stream to achieve acceptable quality in the focused area. As a result, the threshold for sufficient network bandwidth is much higher for VR 360 content. To enable playback with minimal buffering and/or stall risk, viewers should have roughly 1.2-1.5x the connection bandwidth relative to the lowest bitrate available.</li>

      </ul>

          Considerations for All Mobile SDKs</strong></p>
<ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">Only the Ooyala Skin SDK can be used with VR 360 videos. The default skin and custom

        <li class="li">When presenting stereoscopic content in iOS or Android apps, touch and drag navigation

        <li class="li">If you are presenting stereoscopic videos, it is not recommended that you mix them with
          flat ads, as the user would be using a stereoscopic head-mounted device for viewing, and
          the flat videos would not display properly.</li>

To support VR content
      in your iOS/tvOS app, you need to add the OoyalaVRSDK.framework or OoyalaVRTVSDK.framework as
      part of your app project. Do <em class="ph i">not</em> include the OoyalaSDK.framework because they do not
      work well together. You will have access to everything that the OoyalaSDK.framework provides
      with the OoyalaVRSDK only. For sample apps:<ul class="ul">

<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Android Requirements</strong></p>
To support VR content in your Android app, you need to
      add the OoyalaVRSDK.jar library as part of your app project. You should also include the
      OoyalaSDK.jar because it is a dependency of the OoyalaVRSDK.jar library. <ul class="ul">
