 <h1 class="title topictitle1">Debugging/Troubleshooting Extension for Chrome in Player V3 (Deprecated)</h1>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"> Use our Chrome extension to help Ooyala debug video problems you might
    encounter.</p>

   <div class="section"><div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Ooyala Player V3 is deprecated and is scheduled
    to be <em class="ph i">disabled</em> on 2018-01-31. After that date, Player V3 will no longer play your video
    or audio content. Customers still using Player V3 need to migrate to Player V4 (see <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_v3.html">Migrating from Player V3</a> and <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_faq.html">Player Migration FAQ</a>).</div>
Ooyala offers a debugging/troubleshooting tool to help you gather information for Ooyala
      Technical Support about problems you might have with your HTML5 or Flash video player
      implementation. A summary of the steps is as follows:<ol class="ol" id="player_troubleshootingtool__ol_gvb_rl5_rl">
        <li class="li">You run the tool yourself to collect debugging details. In many cases, you can solve
          your problems yourself by looking at the debugging log. The tool bundles information into
          a URL and downloads logs and other debugging files.</li>

        <li class="li">You open a technical support request, supply the URL with the debugging information, and
          attach the saved logs to the request.</li>

        <li class="li">Brightcove Technical Support or engineering use the debugging information to help isolate
          the problem.</li>

      </ol>
</div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Supported Browser: Chrome</h2>
      
      <p class="p">The debugging/troubleshooting tool works only in conjunction with Google Chrome.</p>

    </div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Installing the Extension</h2>
       Download and install the extension from this
          link:<p class="p"><a class="xref" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ooyala-debugging-tools/jdnnlngeejpofgpaahjpkgdadiccfcil" target="_blank">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ooyala-debugging-tools/jdnnlngeejpofgpaahjpkgdadiccfcil</a>.</p>

      <p class="p">When prompted to allow the tool access, click <span class="ph uicontrol">Add</span>.</p>

    </div>

   <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Modes of Operation: Debugging Your Own Site</h2>
     
     The debugger has two modes:
     <ol class="ol">
       <li class="li">Debug against values you enter on the site debug.ooyala.com. <p class="p">This mode is described in the majority of this document.</p>
</li>

       <li class="li">Debug your own player v3 site. <p class="p">This is described in <a class="xref" href="#player_troubleshootingtool__debug_own_site">Debugging Your Own v3 Site</a>.</p>
</li>

     </ol>

   </div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Before Running the Tool</h2>
   
   <div class="p">You need the following details to run the debugger:<ul class="ul" id="player_troubleshootingtool__ul_r5t_zk5_rl">
     <li class="li">The embed code (also called content ID or asset ID) of the problematic video.</li>

     <li class="li">The player branding ID (or player ID) of the player in use when you encounter the
      issue.</li>

     <li class="li">Advanced details (only if you use them) as described in <a class="xref" href="#player_troubleshootingtool__debugger_advanced">Working with HTML5 or Advanced Settings</a>.</li>

    </ul>
</div>

  </div>

 
  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Running the Tool</h2>
   
   <div class="p">To start the tool, click the Ooyala logo at the upper right of your browser window.<div class="fig fignone">
          <img class="image" id="player_troubleshootingtool__image_fnh_kmv_rl" src="../image/debugtool_screenies/2add_extension.png"/>
        </div>
</div>

      <div class="p">
        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> By default, the debugger works with Ooyala Flash-based player. If you need to debug
          HTML5, see <a class="xref" href="#player_troubleshootingtool__debugger_advanced">Working with HTML5 or Advanced Settings</a>.</div>

      </div>

   <p class="p">Follow the onscreen steps. Use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Show Me</span> buttons to orient
        yourself.</p>

      <p class="p">Make note of where on your computer you download the HTTP archive (HAR) file and the player
        logs. You need to attach these files to the support request you might need to create.</p>

  </div>

   <div class="section" id="player_troubleshootingtool__examineconsole"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Examining the Console Output</h2>
      You can examine the output written to the console
      to isolate your problem. In many cases, you yourself will be able to isolate and solve your
      issues, independently from Brightcove Technical Support.<p class="p">As a start, look for error or warning
        messages. This is an example of a SEVERE log message, with the log line number to the
        left:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"> 829 SEVERE &gt;&gt; Error Screen: removedContent (content): error.content_unavailable - error.removed_content </pre>

      On the right of the console is a search field that supports regular expressions (regexps):<div class="fig fignone">
        <img class="image" id="player_troubleshootingtool__image_adg_2pc_sl" src="../image/debugtool_screenies/debugtool_regexp.png" height="64" width="183"/>
      </div>

      <p class="p">Enter a search string (regular expression or otherwise). As you type, the occurrences of
        that string are filtered from the entire log and displayed.</p>
Many of the error messages
      that can occur are described in the following topics:<ul class="ul" id="player_troubleshootingtool__ul_jpb_tqc_sl">
        <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="../api/player_ui_error_msgs.html" title="Error messages are displayed to the video viewer or audio listener during playback. Errors can be categorized as general errors, Flash-based errors and Pay-Per-View errors, which are prefixed with a PPV.">Flash-based Player V3 Error Messages (Deprecated)</a></li>

        <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="../api/player_v3_api_errors.html" title="From the OO.EVENTS.ERROR event, the Ooyala Player can show specific error messages.">HTML5-based Player V3 Error Messages (Deprecated)</a></li>

      </ul>
</div>

  <div class="section" id="player_troubleshootingtool__chickfilaticket"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Filing a Ticket</h2>
   
   <div class="p">If the console messages are not helpful in isolating your problem, the final step of this
        process is for you to open a support request on Ooyala's Support Center. In addition to
        describing the issue, be sure to:<ul class="ul" id="player_troubleshootingtool__ul_whx_4mv_rl">
          <li class="li">Paste the link from the <span class="ph uicontrol">Get URL</span> step into the request.</li>

          <li class="li">Attach both the downloaded HAR file and the downloaded player logs.</li>

        </ul>
</div>

  </div>

 <div class="section" id="player_troubleshootingtool__debugger_advanced"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Working with HTML5 or Advanced Settings</h2>
   
   <p class="p">If you need to gather debug info for HTML5, click the <span class="ph uicontrol">Advanced</span> tab. In
        the lower left, click the checkbox for <span class="ph uicontrol">Use HTML5</span> and follow the
        onscreen steps.</p>

   <div class="p">You can set other advanced options on this tab:<ul class="ul" id="player_troubleshootingtool__ul_dl1_fl5_rl">
     <li class="li">The player v3 version override. </li>

     <li class="li">The player v3 options hash. These are parameters passed in the third argument on the
              <samp class="ph codeph">OO.Player.create()</samp> call. For example, the parameters
              <samp class="ph codeph">height</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">width</samp>, and <samp class="ph codeph">autoplay</samp> below
            are part of the options hash:
            <pre class="pre codeblock">
var videoPlayer = OO.Player.create('playerwrapper',
         'embed_code', {
         height:100%,
         width:100%,
         autoplay:true,
         .... 
  });
       </pre>

            Be sure to enter only the parameters and their values. No braces or other delimiters on
            the call are needed.</li>

   </ul>
</div>

 </div>

   <div class="section" id="player_troubleshootingtool__debug_own_site"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Debugging Your Own v3 Site</h2>
     
    <p class="p">The default site for debugging, debug.ooyala.com, is a "vanilla", generic implementation of Player v3 designed for simple debugging tasks
      and which does not cover all possible player v3 configurations and settings.</p>

     <p class="p">For this reason, you might debug against the debug.ooyala.com site but not experience a
        problem you encounter on your own site. This is an indication that the problem is specific
        to your site.</p>

     <div class="p">Therefore, it is sometimes essential to debug directly against your own site. This is easily done:
     <ol class="ol">
       <li class="li">In your browser, bring up the suspect page that has player v3 embedded in it.</li>

       <li class="li">Open the <strong class="ph b">Chrome Developer Tools</strong> as shown below.<div class="fig fignone">
              <img class="image" id="player_troubleshootingtool__image_n4z_ppk_xl" src="../image/player_debugging_chrom_dev_tools.png" height="345" width="431"/>
            </div>
</li>

          <li class="li">Refresh your page if you are instructed to do so.</li>

          <li class="li">Click <strong class="ph b">Ooyala Panel</strong> in the Developer Tools Panel. </li>

          <li class="li">In the Ooyala Flash Console, click <strong class="ph b">Reload Page</strong>. </li>

          <li class="li">Play the problematic video.</li>

          <li class="li">If an issue occurs, click <strong class="ph b">Save HAR File</strong> and <strong class="ph b">Save Player Logs</strong>.</li>

       <li class="li">Follow the instructions above under <a class="xref" href="#player_troubleshootingtool__examineconsole">Examining the Console Output</a> and <a class="xref" href="#player_troubleshootingtool__chickfilaticket">Filing a Ticket</a>.</li>

     </ol>
</div>

   </div>

   <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Isolating the Ooyala Player</h2>
     
     <p class="p">Any website that uses Ooyala's V3 code has a method OO.Player.isolate(). Using this method
        in your browser's JavaScript console, you can generate a "debug.ooyala.com" URL with an
        Ooyala Player, shown below. </p>

     <div class="fig fignone"><img class="image" src="../image/isolate_ooyala_player.png"/></div>

     <p class="p">This Player is configured as closely to your website as possible but isolated to our test
        site. When you have issues with your Ooyala Player, use isolate() to determine if the issue
        is due to the website environment, or issues with the Ooyala player itself. If you have
        multiple Ooyala Players on your website, you will have to specify which player to isolate by
        using OO.Player.isolate("div-id").</p>
