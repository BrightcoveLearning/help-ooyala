 <h1 class="title topictitle1">Publishing Rules</h1>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Publishing rules give you complete control over your content by enabling you to control where and when it can be viewed.</p>

  <p class="p">Publishing rules enable you to: </p>

  <ul class="ul">
   <li class="li">Allow or restrict website domains that can show your content—you can either specify a list of domains that are allowed to embed your content or specify a list of domains that cannot embed your content.</li>

   <li class="li">Allow or prevent your content from being viewed in specific geographic regions, DMAs, IP
    addresses, and US ZIP codes—you can specify a list to countries, DMA regions, IP
    addresses, and US ZIP codes to allow or block.</li>

    <li class="li">Detect and restrict anonymous proxy connections. <p class="p">For example, a user in country X spoofs
     his IP address through a VPN/proxy to look like he's in country Y to accesses content only
     permitted in country Y. You can set up anonymous proxy controls to restrict this user from
     viewing your content. </p>
</li>

   <li class="li">Express embargo rules by restricting your content to specific ranges or recurring
    intervals—you specify a time that is applied around the world, based on your current time
    zone. <p class="p">For example, if you allow content to be viewed from 1:00 to 4:00 from the New York time
     zone (GMT -05:00), the content will be accessible around the world (in geographic regions that
     you allow) from 6:00 to 9:00 GMT.  </p>
</li>

   <li class="li">Limit your content to specific devices—you can currently specify whether to allow iOS devices to view your content.</li>

  </ul>

  <p class="p">You can use any combination of publishing rules to meet your requirements. For example, you might want to only allow your content to be viewed in the United States, between 6:00 PM and 11:00 PM, on non-iOS devices.</p>
