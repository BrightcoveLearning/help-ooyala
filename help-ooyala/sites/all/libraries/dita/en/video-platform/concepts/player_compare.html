 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Helps you decide which Player V3 to implement: the HTML5 Player or Flash
  Player.</p>

  <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Ooyala Player V3 is deprecated and is scheduled
    to be <em class="ph i">disabled</em> on 2018-01-31. After that date, Player V3 will no longer play your video
    or audio content. Customers still using Player V3 need to migrate to Player V4 (see <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_v3.html">Migrating from Player V3</a> and <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_faq.html">Player Migration FAQ</a>).</div>

  <div class="section">
   <div class="p">Player V3 provides the ability to let the player automatically switch between HTML5 and Flash
    to optimize itself to its environment. <ul class="ul">
     <li class="li">You can embed a player on your web page that supports Flash with a fallback to HTML5 for
      devices that do not support Flash.</li>

     <li class="li">You can also set HTML5 as the default player with Flash as a fallback for cases where HTML5
      is not supported.</li>

     <li class="li">If you want to provide a completely consistent, though possibly less powerful playback
      experience, you can set HTML5 as your default player.</li>

    </ul>
 When deciding how best to approach using the player, consider the following examples. </div>
