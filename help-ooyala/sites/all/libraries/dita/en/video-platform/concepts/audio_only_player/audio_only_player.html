            Audio-Only Player</strong></h1>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <div class="section">
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Overview</strong></p>

            <p class="p">The Audio-Only Player functionality enables Ooyala customers (such as broadcasters,
                publishers, operators, and other organizations who offer audio-primary or audio-only
                content, or have a mixture of audio and video) to use the Ooyala platform as a
                one-stop shop that enables them to offer Audio-Only playback experience across web
                and mobile for live audio streaming (through OoyalaLIVE), audio-on-demand (through
                OoyalaPLAY), and syndication for podcasting (as well as to process live and
                on-demand audio content). </p>

            <p class="p">This is suitable for organizations who are looking to provide a holistic OTT
                experience that manages video and audio content in a single platform (such as Live
                and On-Demand radio offerings) in areas like education, news and sports content,
                faith-based organizations, enterprise companies offering conferences or internal
                meetings via audio-only platforms, and more. </p>

            <p class="p">As a result, Ooyala customers are enabled to:</p>

            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">provide their users with a more comprehensive OTT offering with both video and
                    audio,</li>

                <li class="li">add new monetization models,</li>

                <li class="li">reach new end users,</li>

                <li class="li">reach the same end users more often, and</li>

                <li class="li">keep audiences engaged listening to streams when they are unable to watch (for
                    example, while driving or when they have limited connection bandwidth).</li>

            </ul>

            
        </div>

        <div class="section"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Functionality</strong></p>

            <p class="p">The Audio-Only Player functionality currently supports the following features:</p>

            <div class="p"><ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><p class="p">Audio-Only playback experience across web and mobile for:</p>

                    <li class="li">Audio On Demand (via OoyalaPLAY)</li>

                    <li class="li">Syndication and download for Podcasting - this is an augmentation of the
                                currently supported syndication controls to allow audio-only

            </ul>
</div>

            <p class="p">In more detail:</p>
<ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Playback support for clear streaming (Live, VOD) with HLS in AAC (currently only
                    supported for Ooyala HTML5 Player, iOS and Android SDKs).</li>

                <li class="li">Ability to create and manage an Audio-Only Player in Backlot</li>

                <li class="li">Audio-On-Demand file support for customers on Elemental or Azure encoder</li>

                <li class="li">Podcast syndication support of Audio-On-Demand (using OGG and M4A progressive formats)</li>

            </ul>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">How it works</strong></p>

            <p class="p">Audio-Only Player employes the same workflows that are used for video playback, just
                with different settings and some limitations in supported functionality at the
                current stage. The following actions are typically used:</p>

            <div class="p">
                <ol class="ol">
                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Ingestion of source file(s).</strong><p class="p">This can be done via Backlot, OIS
                            Basic Ingest, and/or OIS Manifest Ingest. In Backlot, we now provide a
                            default Audio-Only Player profile that is available for all users (see
                            the next section) - selecting this default Audio-Only Player
                            automatically classifies the output as audio-only. However, when you use
                            OIS ingestion, you can specify different processing profiles too that
                            combine the different audio/video outcome combinations. For example -
                            audio targeted for video (in which case a slate is added), or video
                            targeted for audio (in which case only the audio content is generated),
                            or video that can be used both for audio-only streams and video+audio
                            streams. For more information about ingestion, see <a class="xref" href="../../../../../../../../video-platform/concepts/audio_only_player/audio_only_player_asset_processing.html" target="_blank">Audio-Only Player: Asset
                                Processing</a>.</p>

                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Transcoding of assets.</strong><p class="p">With the introduction of Audio-Only Player,
                            the following transcoding outputs are now available:</p>

                            However, there are some differences, as follows:</p>
