 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Ooyala player supports the new HTML5 standard for a wide array of devices.
  Supporting this standard offers increasing opportunities for expanding your video market and
  increasing monetization options. </p>

  <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Ooyala Player V3 and V2 have been deprecated and are scheduled
    to be disabled. For details and alternatives, see the <a class="xref" href="../relnotes/2017-06-04.html">OVP Release Notes</a>.</div>

<div class="section">
   <p class="p">HTML5 is an emerging web standard that enables you to reach a wider audience on many different
    devices without having to re-code an app or web page for each device. Users donâ€™t have to
    install and reinstall the same app on their different devices. </p>

   <p class="p">Important to video consumers, HTML5 includes support for video through a &lt;video&gt; tag. In
    addition to its HTML attributes, this video tag provides an extensive JavaScript API for
    controlling its content. The player supports both the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag and &lt;flash&gt;
    playback. If Flash is supported and present on a device, Player uses Flash. On mobile devices if
    Flash is not present or supported, the player uses HTML5. </p>

   <p class="p">The Ooyala player not only enables you to take advantage of the benefits of HTML5, it also
    continues to support Flash players. Essentially, Player makes the best choice of player
    depending upon your device capabilities. You use the new embed style for both types of players. </p>
