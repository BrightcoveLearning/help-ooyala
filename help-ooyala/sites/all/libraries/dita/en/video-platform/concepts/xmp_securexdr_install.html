  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Secure XDR code sample can help you get started in creating a multi-feature playback
    experience with Ooyala Cross-Device Resume, Google IMA ads integration, and Ooyala Player Token
    authentication. </p>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Overview</h2><div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Ooyala Player V3 is deprecated and is scheduled
    to be <em class="ph i">disabled</em> on 2018-01-31. After that date, Player V3 will no longer play your video
    or audio content. Customers still using Player V3 need to migrate to Player V4 (see <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_v3.html">Migrating from Player V3</a> and <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_faq.html">Player Migration FAQ</a>).</div>

      
      <p class="p">Secure XDR is a multi-feature code sample that you can inspect and use as a template for
        working with Player V3 features, the <a class="xref" href="book_api_player.html" title="The Player V3 API is a JavaScript API for customizing your Player v3 functionality and UI elements that also provides message bus event handling.">Player APIs</a> and <a class="xref" href="player_v3_dev_eventmodel.html" title="The HTML5 Player V3 incorporates the use of a message bus to handle events.">EVENTS</a>. This
        sample has two basic parts: </p>

      <ul class="ul" id="player_v3_dev_intro__ul_svp_dpw_fm">
        <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Server-side logic</strong> implemented in PHP. We use CodeIgniter as our PHP framework and
          a controller. In this sample, the controller takes care of routing, handling requests, and
          sending parameters to each client-side view.</li>

        <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Client-side views (web pages)</strong> that implement Player features including a simple
          player embed, Cross-Device Resume, Google IMA, Message Bus-based event handling, Ooyala
          Token Authentication, and all of these features used in combination. The views are
          additive: they progress from the simplest interaction to the final view, which contains
          all of the code for the features used in combination. </li>

      </ul>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Where to Find the Code</h2>
      
      <p class="p"> All of the sample code is located in the application directory. To get to this code in our GitHub repository, use the URL: <a class="xref" href="https://github.com/ooyala/code-samples/blob/master/application" target="_blank">https://github.com/ooyala/code-samples/blob/master/application</a>.</p>

      <p class="p">To work with this sample, you only need to focus on the code in these directories:
          <strong class="ph b">assets</strong>, <strong class="ph b">config</strong>, <strong class="ph b">controllers</strong>, <strong class="ph b">libraries</strong>, <strong class="ph b">third_party</strong>,
        and <strong class="ph b">views</strong>.</p>

      <p class="p">The following diagram shows the organization of the Secure XDR and Google IMA directories.
        You will see other directories. These are for another sample, so you can skip over them. </p>

      <p class="p">To install the Sample Code, you need to:</p>

      <div class="p">
        <ol class="ol" id="player_v3_dev_intro__docs-internal-guid--76eb343-7d9d-0d2d-6698-8e3eb79b3cea">
          <li class="li">Have your Customer Success Manager enable Ooyala Player Token, Google IMA, and
            Cross-Device Resume features, if you do not already have them.</li>

          <li class="li">Have a web server running that can interpret PHP, like Apache or Nginx.</li>

          <li class="li">Go to our GitHub repository. The URL is: <a class="xref" href="https://github.com/ooyala/code-samples" target="_blank">https://github.com/ooyala/code-samples</a>. </li>

          <li class="li">Clone the GitHub code-samples repository in your server.</li>

          <li class="li">Provide your local path in your browser URL. The path for the example would be
            "your_base_path/code-samples/index.php". So, if you are running this from your
            localhost, you will have a URL like "localhost/code-samples/index.php".</li>

          <li class="li">To get more than the default welcome page, you need to modify the values in <samp class="ph codeph">
              application/config/ooyala_config.php</samp>. There you will be asked for you API
            key, secret, embed code and some other stuff. For more information about this you can
            check our <a class="xref" href="api_keys.html" title="Your Ooyala API credentials include your API key and secret, which you provide to sign HTTP requests and when using the scratchpad.">API keys and Partner Code

          </li>

        </ol>

      </div>

      <p class="p">Use the Ooyala PHP Server SDK included with the sample in GitHub. If needed, you can also
        download the Ooyala PHP Server SDK from the <strong class="ph b">Ooyala Support &gt; Developers &gt;Resources</strong>
