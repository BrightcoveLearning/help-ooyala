   <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Ooyala Player V3 and V2 have been deprecated and are scheduled
    to be <em class="ph i">disabled</em> on 2018-01-31. After that date, Player V3 and Player V2 will no longer

   <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Elements of the Embed Code</h2>
     
     <p class="p">Before starting, it might help to review the elements of an embed code that you get from
        Backlot. Typically, your embed code is a URL that looks something like the following: </p>

   </div>

   <div class="section">
     
     <pre class="pre codeblock">
&lt;script src="http://player.ooyala.com/v3/&lt;player_branding_id&gt;"&lt;/script&gt;  
&lt;div id='playerContainer'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  
</pre>
 
   </div>

   <div class="section">The embed code is constructed of the following segments:  
<div class="tablenoborder"><table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" id="player_v3_embedcode_diff__table_phy_4cn_lh" class="table" frame="border" border="1" rules="all">

                it is compiled specifically for the player id that you provide.</td>

  <div class="section">Before you begin migrating from prior player versions, it will help to understand the difference between the
      embed code models. The following examples show the difference between legacy player embed code
      and the current Player embed code. </div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Simple Legacy Player Embed Code</h2>
   
    <p class="p">With legacy Ooyala players, you referenced the player by providing a
          <samp class="ph codeph">playerId</samp> parameter to the player. For example, you might specify
        'myPlayer' for the playerId. You then reference the player using the DOM element lookup
          <samp class="ph codeph">$('#myPlayer')</samp>. In these legacy players you reference the player object
        (player.js) and specify some customization attributes such as width and height using Ooyala
        query string parameters. In the following example this is followed by the actual embed code
        string that you obtain from Backlot or create manually. </p>

  </div>

  <div class="section">
<pre class="pre codeblock">
&lt;script src="http://player.ooyala.com/player.js?width=&lt;width&gt;&amp;height=&lt;height&gt;
&amp;embedCode=replace_with_embed_code&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  
</pre>
 
  </div>

   <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Simple Player Embed Code</h2>In contrast with prior legacy
      players, the current Ooyala Player enables you to reference the player object directly. To
      reference the current Ooyala Player equivalent of the legacy player.js, you just call the
      object returned from the <span class="keyword apiname">OO.Player.create()</span>. This object can be safely
      stored anywhere for future use. The following example illustrates the way that you create of a
      simple Ooyala Player. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> To work, the URL <samp class="ph codeph">"http://player.ooyala.com/v3/..."
        </samp> always requires a valid player branding id. </div>
<pre class="pre codeblock">
&lt;script src="http://player.ooyala.com/v3/&lt;player_branding_id&gt;"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  
&lt;div id='playerContainer'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  
&lt;script&gt;
var myPlayer = OO.Player.create('playerContainer', 'replace_with_embed_code', {
  width: &lt;width&gt;, height: &lt;height&gt;
});
&lt;/script&gt;
