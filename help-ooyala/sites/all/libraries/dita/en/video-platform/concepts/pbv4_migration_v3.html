            with: <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="pbv4_about.html">Player V4</a> for an overview</li>

                <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="pbv4_gs.html">Getting Started with Player V4</a> to help you assess your
                    technical requirements for Player V4 deployment</li>

                <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="../reference/pbv4_web_tutorial.html">Basic Tutorial for Player V4</a>
                    for a walkthrough of basic Player V4 features</li>

            </ul>
The easiest way to begin migrating to Player V4 is to start by using Ooyala as the
            default host for Player V4 resources (see <a class="xref" href="pbv4_resources.html">Ooyala-hosted Player V4 Resources</a>). </div>

        <div class="section" id="pbv4_migration_from_v3__existing"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Using Existing Video Assets and Players</h2>If you have
            already been publishing videos using Ooyala Player V3, you can re-use the following
            elements in Ooyala Player V4 for HTML5. <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Existing Video Assets</strong></p>
 If you
            already have video assets defined in Backlot, you can play them (using their Content
            IDs) in Player V4 if they are supported by HTML5 Player V3, along with HLS on additional
            devices and DASH on additional platforms. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The HTTP Dynamic Streaming (HDS), including Akamai HDS (or HD2)
    streaming protocol, use Flash. Browsers have been disabling and blocking the Flash plugin. As a
    result, Ooyala strongly recommends that customers encode and use HLS and Dash moving
    forward.</div>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Existing Players</strong></p>
If you have existing players defined in Backlot, you can
            re-use them by converting them to a Player V4 player. In the Backlot UI, simply go to
            PUBLISH &gt; Player Branding &gt; Player, select your player, then change the player version
            to V4. Note that any existing Player V3 settings that are not supported in Player V4
            will be lost. Alternatively, you can simply start over and create a new player (see
                <a class="xref" href="../tasks/player_create.html" title="You can create and configure as many players as you want in Backlot. You can associate a player with as many videos as you want. For Player V3, you can also associate a player with audio assets, channels, or channel sets.">Creating a Player in Backlot</a>). <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Other Assets</strong></p>

            You can also re-use images, remote assets, and closed captions (supported formats only;
            see <a class="xref" href="pbv4_closed_caption_settings.html">Closed Captions in Player V4</a>). </div>

            describes a few common types of migrations from <span class="ph">Player V3</span> to <span class="ph">Player V4</span>. <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Basic
                    Migration</strong></p>
<p class="p">If you do not have existing Player V3 ad plugins or
                customizations, dynamic skinning, or Discovery, your migration tasks are
                straightforward. For each HTML page on which you have embedded Player V3, replace
                the HTML Embed Code (from Backlot) with the new V4 HTML5 Standard Player Embed Code
                (from Backlot, see <a class="xref" href="../tasks/publishing_manual_embed.html">Configuring Player Embed Settings in Backlot</a>), then save and test your changes. See <a class="xref" href="pbv4_embed.html">Embedding Player V4 on a Web Page</a> for more information.
                    </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Customers Using Ads</strong></p>
If you use ads with Player V3, you will
            need to start using the Player V4 ad plugins. <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">To use an ad plugin, <a class="xref" href="../tasks/pbv4_integrate_ads.html">load the ad plugin</a> on the HTML5 page where you load your
                    video player and test to see that your ad functionality works as expected. See
                        <a class="xref" href="pbv4_ads.html">Ads in Player V4</a> for
                    details.</li>

                <li class="li">If you use Backlot to generate your HTML embed code (see <a class="xref" href="../tasks/publishing_manual_embed.html">Configuring Player Embed Settings in Backlot</a>): <ul class="ul">
                        <li class="li">The V4 HTML5 Standard Player Embed Code automatically includes the
                            Pulse, Google IMA, Freewheel and VAST ad plugins. Do not add these
                            plugins on the web page. If your player deployment requires a plugin
                            that is not automatically included, you must add any required plugins
                            manualy.</li>

                        <li class="li">The V4 HTML5 Player Embed Code (Advanced) does <em class="ph i">not</em> include ad
                            plugins, even if you apply ad settings in Backlot. You must also
                            manually add the desired ad plugins.</li>

                    </ul>
</li>

                <li class="li">If you used page-level ad parameters with Player V3, see <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_versions.html">Ad
                        Configuration Parameters and Settings</a> for changes to the ad
                    configuration parameters and settings. Some of the parameters you used in Player
                    V3 might be deprecated in Player V4. You might need to update your page-level
                    settings accordingly.</li>

            </ul>

        <div class="section"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Customers Using Discovery</strong></p>
If you used Discovery with Player V3 and
            want to continue to use it with Player V4, you might need to load the Player V4
            Discovery plugin on the HTML5 page where you load your video player. If you use Backlot
            to generate your HTML embed code (see <a class="xref" href="../tasks/publishing_manual_embed.html">Configuring Player Embed Settings in Backlot</a>): <ul class="ul" id="pbv4_migration_from_v3__ul_ukr_n25_b1b">
                <li class="li">The V4 HTML5 Standard Player Embed Code automatically includes the Discovery
                    plugins. Do not add the Discovery plugin on the web page. If your player
                    deployment requires a plugin that is not automatically included, you must add
                    any required plugins manually.</li>

                <li class="li">The V4 HTML5 Player Embed Code (Advanced) does <em class="ph i">not</em> include the Discovery
                    plugin, even if you apply discovery settings in Backlot. You must manually add
                    the Discovery plugin. For example:
                    <pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;script src="//player.ooyala.com/core/MY_PLAYER_ID"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="//player.ooyala.com/static/v4/production/other-plugin/discovery_api.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
</li>

 If you use customized
            plugins, CSS, and JavaScript with Player V3, read through the rest of this topic to
            identify which Player V4 changes affect your ad plugins, analytics plugins, and the
            Player API. Take the appropriate actions to implement the changes in Player V4. For CSS
