    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Closed Captions in Player V4</h1>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <div class="section">Closed captions are additional text shown within a video during playback. The captions typically contain an audio transcript of the video. For an overview, see 
            <a class="xref" href="chapter_closed_captions.html" title="You can add closed captions to your videos.">Managing Closed Captions</a>
        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">User Experience with Closed Captions</h2>
            <p class="p">If closed captions are available for a video, end users can click the CC button on
                the Player V4 control bar to open the closed captions screen for all browsers with
                web and mobile platforms. In the closed captions screen end users can enable or
                disable closed captions in the language of their choice and apply color, opacity,
                and font styling settings.</p>

            <p class="p">In Player V4, closed captions consist of the text, background, and window. The window
                is a rectangle that contains the background, which contains the text.</p>

            <div class="fig fignone">
                <img class="image" src="../image/pbv4_cc_sample.png"/>
            </div>

            <p class="p">From the closed captions screen end users can preview what the closed captions will
                look like on the player before applying settings. Note that if closed captions are
                off, when you make a selection in the GUI, for example, selecting a language, closed
                captions will automatically turn on with that setting applied.</p>

            <div class="fig fignone">

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Configuration Options in Player V4</h2>
            <p class="p">By default, if closed caption files are available for a video, they will be enabled
                and shown in English. You can configure the default behavior and language of closed captions for your player 
                in <span class="ph filepath">skin.json</span> by modifying the <samp class="ph codeph">enabled</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">language</samp> attributes of the <samp class="ph codeph">closedCaptionOptions</samp> object.</p>
</div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Supported Input Formats</h2>
            <p class="p">Closed caption files should be uploaded to Backlot along with your video files. For
                details on how to upload closed caption files to Backlot, see <a class="xref" href="closed_captions_ingest.html" title="You can ingest closed caption files via Backlot or the Ooyala Ingestion Service (OIS).">Ingesting Closed Caption Files</a> and <a class="xref" href="../tasks/closed_captions_upload.html" title="After preparing a closed caption file, you can upload it to Backlot.">Uploading a Closed Caption File in Backlot</a>.</p>

            <div class="p">The following input formats are supported for Player V4 closed captions: <ul class="ul">

            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Any styling settings specified in the closed caption file will be ignored.</div>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">FCC Compliance</h2>
            
            <div class="p">Player V4 is now Federal Communications Commission (FCC) compliant and supports FCC
                closed caption styling per the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video
                Accessibility Act (<a class="xref" href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/21st-century-communications-and-video-accessibility-act-cvaa" target="_blank">CVAA)</a> requirements. FCC
                compliant closed caption styling allows the end user to change how the closed
                captions appear on the player, including: <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">Multi-language support</li>

                    <li class="li">Font</li>

                    <li class="li">Text size</li>

                    <li class="li">Text, background, and window color</li>

                    <li class="li">Text, background, and window opacity</li>

                    <li class="li">Text styling</li>

                </ul>

            </div>

            <p class="p">If closed captions are available for a video, the end user has the ability to apply
                the styling mentioned above.</p>

            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> FCC closed caption styling is only supported on the web Player versions 4.5+ for
                desktop web and mobile web. The native SDKs do not have any styling settings within
                the Ooyala Player. For Android, the Android Skin SDK uses the operating system's
                closed caption styling information to render closed captions. As of June 23, 2016,
                the iOS Skin SDK does not support FCC closed caption styling. We are working on
                adding this functionality. The Android Skin SDK supports FCC closed caption
                styling.</div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Storing Closed Caption Settings</h2>
            
            <p class="p">With the closed caption screen UI controls, end users can make changes to closed
                caption styles on the fly. Player V4 saves closed caption settings automatically in
                the browser. If a user changes a setting (for example, chooses a different font
                color), the change remains in effect when they open a new browser tab or window, or
                launch a new browser session. The information is saved using local storage key
                    <span class="keyword parmname">"ooyala_player_settings"</span>. The
                OO.EVENTS.SAVE_PLAYER_SETTINGS event is triggered when a change is saved.</p>
