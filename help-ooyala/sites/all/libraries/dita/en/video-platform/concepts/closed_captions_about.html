 <h1 class="title topictitle1">About Closed Captions</h1>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Closed captions are additional text shown within a video during playback. The captions
  typically contain an audio transcript of the video.</p>

   <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Benefits of Closed Captions</h2> Closed captions improve the playback
      experience by providing text-based narration for: <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">hearing impaired viewers</li>

        <li class="li">viewers who are not fluent in the spoken language of the video</li>

      </ul>
Adding closed captions has been shown to significantly increase the viewership of online
      content. In addition, regulations require many government and educational sites to have closed
      captions available for their video content. </div>

   <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Considerations for Closed Captions</h2>
     <ul class="ul">
       <li class="li">Although you can technically add closed captions to any type of asset, they make sense primarily
         with videos, remote assets, and YouTube videos.</li>

       <li class="li" id="closed_captions_about.xml__default_behavior">The default behavior of closed captions in Player V3 is "Off". You can
         enable closed captions with the JavaScript function <samp class="ph codeph">setClosedCaptionsLanguage()</samp>,
         described <a class="xref" href="http://community.ooyala.com/t5/Backlot-Users-Knowledge-Base/Auto-Detection-for-Closed-Caption/ta-p/2084" target="_blank">here</a>. </li>

       <li class="li">The Ooyala Android and iOS Mobile SDKs use device-defined Closed Captions Style information. However, some devices, including some older Samsung devices, do not support these features. </li>
