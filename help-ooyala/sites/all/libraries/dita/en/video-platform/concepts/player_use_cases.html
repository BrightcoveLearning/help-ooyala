  <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Ooyala Player V3 is deprecated and is scheduled
    to be <em class="ph i">disabled</em> on 2018-01-31. After that date, Player V3 will no longer play your video
    or audio content. Customers still using Player V3 need to migrate to Player V4 (see <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_v3.html">Migrating from Player V3</a> and <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_faq.html">Player Migration FAQ</a>).</div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Before You Customize</h2>
   
   <div class="p">Deciding on how to customize a player depends on certain factors, such as:
   <ul class="ul">
    <li class="li">The target environment (web or mobile) where the player will run</li>

    <li class="li">The specific player features that you want to customize</li>

    <li class="li">Whether you want to customize the player programmatically, use a GUI tool, or both</li>

   <p class="p">You can create and brand basic players using the Ooyala Backlot REST API or develop
    highly customized Ooyala HTML5 players using JavaScript.</p>

    <p class="p">Providing a player for your viewers is a fairly simple client-side based activity involving
     embedding a code representing the player on a web page.  However, to provide your viewers with a
     unique, branded experience, you need more than just a player. You need the capability to highly
     customize the player experience. Ooyala gives you the capability to create, brand, and embed an
     Ooyala video player at different levels of ease and customization using any one of the following
     client-side mechanisms:</p>
