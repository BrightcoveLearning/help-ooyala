    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Using Closed Captions with Chromecast Integration</h1>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <div class="section">
        <p class="p">You can use closed captions for VOD (all streams) and Live (HLS and eHLS) content with
                the Chromecast Integration. Closed captions are enabled by default on the sample
                sender and receiver applications. By default, the player displays a closed caption
                button for all assets with closed captions. You must copy over the closed caption
                (CC) code from our sample sender and receiver applications to have this supported by
                default on your own sender and receiver applications. For an introduction, see <a class="xref" href="../pbv4_closed_caption_settings.html">Closed Captions in Player V4</a>.</p>

        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The Chromecast Integration currently does not support user styling (FCC styling), but
                we are working on implementing this in the future.</div>
</div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Supported Closed Caption Formats</h2>
                <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">TTML (formerly DFXP)</li>

                    <li class="li">Embedded CES-608/708 (Live)</li>

                </ul>

            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> For closed caption support on iOS and Android, you must ingest files in TTML (formerly DFXP) format.</div>

          For additional information, see <a class="xref" href="../../reference/closed_caption_language.html" title="Before uploading closed caption files to Backlot, verify that you are using a supported language and file format.">Supported Closed Captions</a>.
        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Workflow</h2>
            
            <div class="p">The following steps outline the workflow for closed captions for VOD assets: <ol class="ol">
                    <li class="li">The sender issues a command to set the language.</li>

                    <li class="li">The receiver accepts and instantiates a <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;track&gt;</samp> element
                        to show CC.</li>

                    <li class="li">The receiver uses Chromecast's browser default support.</li>

                </ol>
</div>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Enablement</h2>
            No enablement is needed. Closed captions are enabled by default
            on the sender and receiver applications. </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Upload Closed Caption Files</h2>Simply upload your closed caption file
            for your asset <a class="xref" href="../../tasks/closed_captions_upload.html" title="After preparing a closed caption file, you can upload it to Backlot.">via the
                Backlot UI</a> or <a class="xref" href="../../api/asset_closed_caption.html" title="You can add closed captions to videos, ads, remote assets, or YouTube videos.">via the Backlot API</a>. </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Sender Application</h2>
            
            <div class="p">The iOS and Android sender applications do the following for closed captions:
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Display a CC button for assets containing CC file (Live, VoD).</li>

                <li class="li">Send a CC message to the Receiver to turn captions on or off.</li>

                <li class="li">Display the current status of CC (on or off) on the sender device via icon highlighting.</li>

            </ul>
</div>

            <div class="p">The end user can do the following with the sender application:
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Turn captions on or off at any time.</li>

                <li class="li">Select or change a caption language at any time.</li>

            </ul>
</div>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Receiver Application</h2>
            
            <p class="p">The receiver application listens to the sender application to display the closed
                caption language selection set by the end user. If the end user changes the closed
                caption language on the sender application, the receiver displays the new language
                closed captions.</p>
