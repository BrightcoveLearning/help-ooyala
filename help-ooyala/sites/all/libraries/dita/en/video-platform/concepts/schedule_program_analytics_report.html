  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Program Analytics Insight Report</h1>

  
  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Program Analytics Insight report summarizes in graphical form the audience size and
    other metrics for your programs. </p>

    <p class="p">A "program" in this context is the schedule, assets, and virtual assets you combine with
      Ooyala Schedule to form groups of content to be aired at specified times. For example, with
      Ooyala Schedule you might create a program to run four times in one week. After the program
      airs, the Program Analytics Insight Report aggregates data from all four airings to create
      statistical graphs, which are described here. For more information, refer to the technical
      details in <a class="xref" href="chapter_schedule.html#chapter_schedule" title="With Ooyala Schedule, you combine tracks of virtual assets to play on top of live streams.">Ooyala Schedule</a>.</p>

    <p class="p">The Program Analytics Insights report in PDF is emailed weekly, every Monday morning, to your
      defined distribution list.</p>

    <div class="p">The report has several parts: <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="#schedule_program_analytics_report__ts1">Audience Size by
            Program</a></li>

        <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="#schedule_program_analytics_report__tst2">Program Audience,
            Aggregate and Individual</a></li>

      </ul>
</div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Audience Size by Program</h2>
      The <strong class="ph b">Audience Size by Program</strong> graph
      shows the total number of viewers during the specified period, in descending order, with the
      program with the smallest audience last.<div class="fig fignone">
        <img class="image" src="../image/ooyala_schedule_program_analytics_audience_by_size.png" alt="Audience By Size"/>
      </div>
</div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Program Audience, Aggregate and Individual</h2>For each program,
      the <strong class="ph b">Program Audience</strong> section includes two graphs, both of which correlate specific data
      points the time ticks of the program as it was aired during the reporting period. <div class="p">First,
        the aggregated audience size for the week is shown, mapped to the length of the program. The
        X axis is the length of the program in minutes. All airings of the program in the specified
        time period are combined into this one chart.<div class="fig fignone">
          <img class="image" src="../image/ooyala_schedule_program_analytics_aggregated_audience.png" alt="Aggregated Audience"/>
        </div>
</div>
<div class="p">Second, the <strong class="ph b">Organic/Lead-in</strong> chart correlates the audience size for
        specific airing the "unaggregated" audience of an individual airing of the program. The date
        and time of the airing is shown in the graph title. Again, the X axis is the length of the
        program in minutes.<div class="fig fignone">
          <img class="image" src="../image/ooyala_schedule_program_analytics_organic.png" alt="Organic"/>
