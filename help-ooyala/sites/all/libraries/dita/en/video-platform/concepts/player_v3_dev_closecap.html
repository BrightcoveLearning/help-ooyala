 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Closed Captioning (CC) APIs enable you to get/set supported closed captions and localize
  the Player UI language.</p>

   <div class="section"><div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Ooyala Player V3 is deprecated and is scheduled
    to be <em class="ph i">disabled</em> on 2018-01-31. After that date, Player V3 will no longer play your video
    or audio content. Customers still using Player V3 need to migrate to Player V4 (see <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_v3.html">Migrating from Player V3</a> and <a class="xref" href="pbv4_migration_faq.html">Player Migration FAQ</a>).</div>
<div class="p">The Ooyala Player V3 supports closed captioning (also known as subtitles) for VOD and Live
        Streams. Ooyala supports closed captions for VOD in our iOS and Android SDKs and for Flash
        and iOS Web. For live streams, closed captions are supported for Flash-based devices.
            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <ul class="ul" id="player_v3_dev_locale__ul_bj4_vml_vj">
            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">iOS Web</strong> - Because of the way that closed captions are supported in iOS, we
              are not able to add closed caption data for iOS web for remote assets.</li>
            
           <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Live Streaming</strong> - For live streaming on HTML5 players, if closed caption data
              is available in the stream and the underlying platforms supports it (as iOS does) then
              closed captions are displayed. The player does not facilitate the display of closed
              captions. If closed captions already exist in the stream, the player will not prevent
              them from appearing during playback.</li>
</ul>
 </div>
</div>
<p class="p">For closed captioning to work with live streams, you need to run the broadcast stream through
    your encoder to convert the stream and include Adobe Flash onCuePoint Data. The onCuePoint Data
    can be inserted by many encoders, such as the Cisco 8100 series media encoders. You must
    configure the source encoder to convert the CEA format to the cue points format to include
    closed captions and to have them work properly. The process begins with the capture and encoding
    of the live stream. The live stream is also converted to have include the Flash cue points
    inside the stream. The stream is passed as an RTMP stream (as is) or as an Akamai HD2 live
    stream and is then passed to the Ooyala player. </p>
<p class="p">JavaScript Closed Captioning APIs enable you to get supported closed captions and set closed
    caption languages. In live streaming mode, the closed caption languages are derived from the
    stream itself. The Closed Caption functions are:</p>

   </ul>

    <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The default behavior of closed captions in the V3 Player is "Off". You can enable closed
      captions with <samp class="ph codeph">setClosedCaptionsLanguage()</samp>.</div>

    <p class="p">The player supports a number of LTR and RTL languages for close captioning and UI
   localization. You can review this list in the topic "<a class="xref" href="../reference/closed_caption_language.html#closed_caption_language" title="Before uploading closed caption files to Backlot, verify that you are using a supported language and file format.">Supported
    Closed Caption Languages</a>". </p>

   <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> When the closed caption file is uploaded, not played, Ooyala uses a strict XML parser for handling Closed Captioning. Your closed caption files at
    minimum need to work with your browserâ€™s parser.</div>

  </div>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Live Stream Closed Captions with Custom OPF Modules</h2>
      
      <p class="p">If you are working with an Ooyala Player Framework (OPF) module (Player V3 Flash-based)
        that you want to include in Player V3 and include live stream closed captioning, you will
        need to use the Ooyala Closed Caption APIs. For more information about creating OPF modules,
        contact Sales, your Customer Success Manager, or Technical Support. </p>

      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Closed captioning for live streams only works with the Flash-based OPF module. The
        custom module available with Player V3 is a JavaScript-based module and only supports closed
        captioning for VOD.</div>

      <div class="p">During live stream playback with a custom OPF module, Ooyala will first fire a <samp class="ph codeph">
          OoyalaAPIConstants.CLOSED_CAPTIONS_TEXT_READY</samp> when we receive Closed Caption
        information on the first cue point. If you have a third party OPF UI module: <ol class="ol">
          <li class="li">The module needs to check the available languages whenever this event goes off during
            live stream playback.</li>

          <li class="li">Use <samp class="ph codeph">getCurrentItemClosedCaptionsLanguages()</samp> to perform this check. </li>

          <li class="li">If the live stream happens to add more languages to their available languages in the
            middle of stream playback, Ooyala also fires
              <samp class="ph codeph">CLOSED_CAPTIONS_TEXT_READY.</samp></li>

          <li class="li">You can then enable closed captions as you would with VOD closed captions, using the
              <samp class="ph codeph">setClosedCaptionsLanguage()</samp>function. </li>
