 <h1 class="title topictitle1">Remote Assets</h1>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">A remote asset is a piece of content that is hosted outside of Backlot. Instead of
    uploading, transcoding, and storing the content in Backlot, you simply upload its URL and other
    descriptive information so that Backlot can find the content when needed.</p>

 <p class="p">Remote asset management provides all of the benefits of Backlot, including management, syndication, monetization, analytics, and access to the Ooyala APIs.</p>

 <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Supported Streaming Formats for Remote Assets</h2>Ooyala supports the following
      streaming formats for remote assets: <ul class="ul" id="chapter_remote_asset__ul_cgz_p25_vv">
        <li class="li">dash</li>

        <li class="li">mp4</li>

        <li class="li">HDS</li>

        <li class="li">HLS</li>

        <li class="li">smooth</li>

        <li class="li">rtmp</li>

      </ul>

      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> For iPad and iPhone streams, only MP4 or M3U8 formats are valid.</div>
</div>

 <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Ways to Add Remote Assets</h2> You can add remote assets to Backlot using the
      following ways: <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">Backlot UI (see <a class="xref" href="content_remoteassets.html" title="A remote asset is a piece of content that is hosted outside of Backlot. Instead of uploading, transcoding, and storing the content in Backlot, you simply upload its URL and other descriptive information so that Backlot can find the content when needed.">Remote Assets</a>)</li>

        <li class="li">Backlot API (see <a class="xref" href="../api/asset_remote.html" title="A remote asset is a piece of content that is hosted outside of Backlot. Instead of uploading, transcoding, and storing the content in Backlot, you simply upload its URL and other descriptive information so that Backlot can find the content when needed.">Remote Assets</a>)</li>

        <li class="li">via MRSS (see <a class="xref" href="../tasks/ingestion_mrss_remote_assets.html" title="You can add or update remote assets using Media RSS (MRSS).">Ingesting Remote Assets via MRSS</a>)</li>

      </ul>
After a piece of content is added to Backlot, Ooyala stores basic information about it,
      including the duration and title. Rules, customizations, preview images, and additional
      metadata can be applied to remote assets through the Backlot UI or APIs. </div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Delivering Remote Assets</h2>
Once added, remote assets can be delivered by Ooyala or a CDN of your choice.
 <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> After a remote asset has been created, its propagation to the various CDNs might be delayed 60 seconds or more. If you request a remote asset too soon after its creation, the results will be cached by the CDNs, which might take several minutes to clear. Best practice: after creation, wait 30 or 60 seconds, query with the Backlot API [GET] /v2/assets/asset_id route, and after retrieving the remote asset's embed code (content ID or asset ID), then proceed to embed the asset.</div>
