    <div class="body conbody">
        <div class="p"><div class="note warning"><span class="warningtitle">Warning:</span> The v2 Analytics API has been deprecated. See <a class="xref" href="ooyala_iq_developer_guide.html">Ooyala IQ Analytics</a> for more details on the new
                v3 Analytics API.</div>
There may be differences in the data in v3 Analytics (<span class="ph">Ooyala IQ</span>) when compared to data in v2 <span class="ph">Analytics</span> due to the following: <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Due to the re-processing of data to accommodate the multi-dimensional
                    capabilities, the aggregation of the data may result in slightly different
                    values than in <span class="ph">v2 Analytics</span>. We are also using a new
                    robust architecture in <span class="ph">Ooyala IQ</span> which results in better
                    error handling.</li>

                <li class="li">Ooyala IQ uses Quova, a more accurate geo provider than in v2 Analytics. </li>

                <li class="li">Ooyala IQ uses a more accurate device profiling provider than v2 Analytics, so
                    the aggregation across devices and operating systems may differ. We are now
                    using <span class="ph">UADetector</span> along with <span class="ph">WURFL</span> to optimize mobile and desktop coverage.</li>

                <li class="li">The metrics are defined more accurately. Metrics with new definitions or bug
                    fixes in calculation include: <ul class="ul">
                        <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Playthrough</strong>: <span class="ph">v2 Analytics</span> calculated
                            playthrough on the server side based on the segments watched. There are
                            40 segments for each video. If the 10th segment got watched, Playthrough
                            25% was triggered; if the 30th segment got watched, Playthrough 75% was
                            triggered. This behavior is problematic when people rewind and/or
                            fast-forward. This calculation method did not always take deduplicating
                            into account and did not report segments that users skipped, which at
                            times led to playthrough 75% appearing higher than playthrough 25%, for
                            example. The new analytics has a more accurate <a class="xref" href="analytics_v3_dictionary.html#analytics_v3_dictionary__playthrough">definition of playthrough</a>, which is calculated
                            on the client-side to indicate the furthest quartile point a user has
                            reached within one viewing session. The new calculation deduplicates,
                            reports for the segments that the user skipped, and has a more accurate
                            measure of when the 100% mark is reached. This change in calculation
                            provides more accurate metric data for playthrough. Data after August 1,
                            2014 is calculated using the new playthrough logic. </li>

                        <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Uniques</strong>: The calculation of unique metrics in <span class="ph">v2 Analytics</span> involved looking for cookies on the client side
                            based on event timestamps. The <a class="xref" href="analytics_v3_dictionary.html#analytics_v3_dictionary__viewer">new calculation of uniques</a> is server-side and
                            involves an algorithm called <span class="ph">hyperloglog (HLL)</span>
                            and a <span class="ph">guid</span> that identifies browsers within a
                            device. If the player does not see a <span class="ph">guid</span> a new
                                <span class="ph">guid</span> is generated. This new calculation
                            method reduces bugs, deduplicates, and is more accurate. You may see
                            differences in your “unique” data, but the values should be similar, and
                            any change is due to increased accuracy in “unique” calculation.</li>

                        <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Plays Requested:</strong> We have improved our calculation of this metric.
                            You may see the number of plays requested from your HTML5 and SDK
                            players increase after 11/11/2014 due to this implementation.</li>

                        <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Video Starts:</strong> We have improved our calculation of this metric.
                            You may see the number of video starts from your HTML5 and SDK players
                            decrease after 11/11/2014 due to this implementation.</li>
