      <span class="ph">Player</span> offers a customizable, feature-rich player used to provide
      a top-notch video experience across industries and across multiple devices. </p>

 <div class="section">
        <p class="p">As consumers leverage the freedom that mobile devices provide, they expect video to match what
           they have come to expect on their desktops and to be available across devices.
           Increasingly, HTML5 is becoming the primary and only standard for this type of
           mobile video experience. Ooyala offers the Player to make it easier to give your
           customers this kind of video experience. </p>

     
       <p class="p">The new Ooyala Player enables you to leverage the cross-device, cross-platform compatibility 
          of HTML5 to provide your video and audio content across multiple devices from tablets to mobile phones. 
          The Player  offers a video experience that makes the best use of the technology of your
          devices to give you the freedom to watch your video on multiple devices. By default,
          it also gives you the ability to leverage Flash players when they are available.
          This happens automatically with no impediment to the playback or action by the
          viewer. Your viewers are given the best possible video experience, either HTML5 or
          Flash, available on the device they are using. </p>

       <p class="p">The player also provides similar levels of monetization, extensibility, and customization
          capabilities on mobile devices that you get from Ooyala’s suite of technologies and services for
          the desktop. It also offers a new way to embed players in your web pages that offers more
          control over how and when the player is loaded.</p>

       <p class="p">This guide describes how to use the Ooyala Player features. You can also see our player
            demo at this link: http://demo.ooyala.com/product-demos/playerv3/demo.html </p>
