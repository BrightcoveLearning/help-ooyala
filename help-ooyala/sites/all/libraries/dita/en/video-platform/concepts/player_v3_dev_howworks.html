 <h1 class="title topictitle1"> How Player V3 Works (Deprecated)</h1>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Player V3 provides a simple way to embed video in web pages. </p>

  <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Ooyala Player V3 has been deprecated and is scheduled to be
    disabled. For details and alternatives, see the <a class="xref" href="../relnotes/2017-06-04.html">OVP
     Release Notes</a>.</div>

<div class="section">Player V3 uses an object-based embed style that works in a similar way as other
   object-oriented frameworks (like jQuery). It differs from how you embed video in web pages using
   earlier versions of our player (see <a class="xref" href="player_v3_dev_embedcode_diff.html" title="Before migrating from prior player versions, it will help to understand the difference between the embed code models.">Comparing Embed Code Styles in Player V3 and Player V2 (Deprecated)</a>). This embed style affects all JavaScript embeds (regardless of
   whether you use the HTML5 Player or the Flash player). <p class="p">The latest embed style enables you to
    enclose your player in a type of container using <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;div&gt;</samp> tags. This gives
    you more control over the placement of your videos on a web page. You can build a page with
    player “building blocks” that results in a more responsive-to-change design. For example, if the
    browser is resized, the player can readily flow on the page to adapt to the resizing. The player
    also separates the loading of the player from the creation of the player. You can load once and
    create multiple players based on the original player instance that was loaded. </p>
<p class="p">Player
    loading and creation process works as follows:</p>
<ol class="ol" id="player_v3_dev_howworks__ol_3t1_1qk_lh">
    <li class="li">You specify a player branding id that identifies a particular player to load.</li>

    <li class="li">The player code is loaded.</li>

    <li class="li">Any custom modules are loaded.</li>

    <li class="li">&lt;div&gt; tags are used to create a container for the player and a &lt;div&gt; id is
     specified.</li>

    <li class="li">The player is created and initialized with the JavaScript call:
      <samp class="ph codeph">OO.Player.create.</samp> This call creates a player instance within the <samp class="ph codeph">
      &lt;div&gt;.</samp>
    </li>

   </ol>
