 <h1 class="title topictitle1">Playlists and the Theme Builder User Interface</h1>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">With Theme Builder, you can build asset- or label-based playlists for the Ooyala Player
  V4 or Player V3, use complex templates to build a custom playback experience, and create an embed
  that contains the playlists you construct.</p>

  <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Theme Builder is designed to work with both Ooyala Player V4 and
        Player V3. There are some differences in the way you configure playlists for Player V4, as
        described in <a class="xref" href="pbv4_playlist.html">Using Playlists in Player V4</a>.</div>

  <p class="p">While you can simply brand players in Backlot to give your viewers a custom experience, Theme Builder gives
   you even more control over the video-watching experience of your viewer. You can build playlists by specific video assets or by label. These playlists are then
   displayed in the embed in an invisible container called a pod, which you can also
   customize. For players, you have control over various aspects of the layout,
   controls, and other behaviors. You can see examples of the customizations you can make with Theme Builder in <a class="xref" href="theme_builder_design_choices.html" title="You can customize your viewer's video watching experience in many ways using Theme Builder. This page shows some of the customizations you can make to your players, pods, and screens.">Design Choices</a>.</p>

  <div class="p">With Theme Builder, you create collections of both <dfn class="term">players</dfn> and
    <dfn class="term">playlists</dfn>. With these you can form <dfn class="term">embeds</dfn>, which are specific
   combinations of players and playlists that can be embedded in a web page. These conceptual
   relationships are diagrammed below.<div class="fig fignone">
    <img class="image" src="../image/theme_builder_diagram.png" height="208" width="460"/>
   </div>
</div>

  <p class="p">You can create playlists, pods,
   and embeds with the Theme Builder GUI or programmatically with a combination of requests with
   Backlot API and Ooyala Player V3 JavaScript.</p>

  <p class="p">The following is an example of a Theme Builder embed.</p>

  <img class="image" src="../image/themebuilder_annotateddiagram.png" height="285" width="461"/>
  <p class="p">The embed consists of the following:</p>

  <ul class="ul">
   <li class="li">A video player with the currently selected or default video.</li>

   <li class="li">Playlists, which appear within "pods" outside the video player. Pods are invisible containers
    for playlists and allow you to view playlists. </li>

   <li class="li">Thumbnails for the videos within the selected playlist.</li>

  </ul>

  <p class="p">After having been embedded in a web page, a Theme Builder embed proportionally resizes itself
   automatically to conform with the type of the viewing device, such as desktop, tablet, phone, and
   so on.</p>
