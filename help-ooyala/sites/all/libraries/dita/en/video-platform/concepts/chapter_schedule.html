 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"> With Ooyala Schedule, you combine tracks of virtual assets to play on top of live
  streams.</p>

  <p class="p">Part of Ooyala Guide, with Ooyala Schedule, assets can be programmed linearly over time via one
   or more tracks. The concept is analogous to live television, with multiple channels (or tracks),
   each programmed with a set of linear programming.   </p>

  <p class="p">Ooyala Professional Services group has mechanisms to automate the creation and maintenance of
   schedules. Contact your Customer Success Manager if you are interested in more information.</p>

  <p class="p"> The following concepts are essential to understanding Ooyala Schedule.</p>

      <td class="entry" valign="top" width="90%" headers="d253474e47 ">A schedule is composed of one or more tracks, that define a set of linear programming
       experiences. For example, a sports broadcaster may use different regional tracks as well as a
       national track to air their broadcasts. All of these tracks collectively are the schedule.
       There is no explicit schedule object.</td>

      <td class="entry" valign="top" width="90%" headers="d253474e47 ">A track is composed of one or more linearly scheduled track segments. Track segments in
       a track must not overlap in time; track segments in different tracks can. <div class="p">A track can be
        associated with assets in three general ways:<ul class="ul">
         <li class="li">With a live stream defined in <span class="ph">Backlot</span>, using a previously
          created live stream's asset ID</li>

         <li class="li">With a set of VOD assets defined in <span class="ph">Backlot</span>, using asset
          IDs associated with a track's track segments</li>

         <li class="li">A hybrid of the above, where individual track segment's assets can override the default
          asset associated with the track</li>

        </ul>
</div>
Each track may be optionally bound to a live stream asset ID, providing the default
       24x7 live stream where the track segments will play. It is up to the schedule definition or
       import process to ensure that the track segments defined in an track correspond to what is
       actually being broadcast on the bound live stream embed code. Alternatively, a track may be
       editorially or algorithmically curated from a set of VOD assets. In this scenario, there
       wouldn’t be a default live steam asset ID bound to the track. Rather, each track segment will
       need to include its own embed code, allowing the Player to switch between different VOD
       assets described in the track. A hybrid scenario is also possible, whereby a track is bound
       to a default live stream asset ID, but one or more track segments provide their own override
       asset IDs. In this scenario, the Player prioritizes the asset ID in the track segment, if
       provided; otherwise the track live stream asset ID is used.</td>

     <tr class="row">
      <td class="entry" valign="top" width="10%" headers="d253474e44 ">Track segment</td>

      <td class="entry" valign="top" width="90%" headers="d253474e47 ">A track segment is defined as an instance of a virtual assets at a scheduled start/end
       time in a track. Each track segment is assigned a unique identifier across all track segments
       in the schedule (and not just in a track). In addition to a unique ID and start/end times, a
       track segment also links to its underlying virtual assets containing all of the metadata.
       Lastly, a track segment may also include an override asset ID, that when present will have
       priority by the Player, over the default live stream asset ID from the track. <p class="p">A virtual
        asset can have multiple instances of a track segment, in a track or across all tracks in a
        schedule. For example, if the virtual asset was a Football game, this may be aired multiple
        times within a week in the schedule. In this case, all the metadata structure describing the
        Football game is defined once in the virtual asset. Each time this game is aired in the
        schedule, a different track segment instance is created associated with each airing
        time.</p>

     <tr class="row">

      <td class="entry" valign="top" width="90%" headers="d253474e47 ">A virtual asset is an abstract metadata definition of an individual program or event.
       Unlike video assets defined in <span class="ph">Backlot</span>, a virtual asset is
       decoupled from the underlying asset ID required for video playback. This decoupling allows a
       single program or event to be defined in <span class="ph">Backlot</span> yet included
       multiple times in a schedule or track. For example, a virtual asset defined for the May 31,
       2012, LSU vs California Softball game might first be live-streamed in a track, then
       rebroadcast as VOD later in the day in the same track. The underlying virtual asset is the
       same, but it is aired twice in a track.<p class="p">Like normal assets, a virtual asset can have up to
        100 name/value pairs of custom metadata.</p>
