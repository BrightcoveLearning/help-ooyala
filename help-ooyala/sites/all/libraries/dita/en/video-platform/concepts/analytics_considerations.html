 <h1 class="title topictitle1">Considerations about the Analytics API (Deprecated) </h1>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Be aware of some notable points about the v2 Analytics API, including differences
    between the analytics in the <span class="ph">Backlot UI</span> and the API.</p>

    <div class="p">
      <div class="note warning"><span class="warningtitle">Warning:</span> The v2 Analytics API has been deprecated. See <a class="xref" href="ooyala_iq_developer_guide.html">Ooyala IQ Analytics</a> for more details on the new v3
        Analytics API.</div>

    </div>

  <p class="p">Some considerations about the data available from the analytics API are noted below, some in
      comparison with analytics in the Backlot UI.</p>

  <ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Time</strong>
        <p class="p">Because they are based on different clock start times, date/time ranges in Analytics UI
          and Analytics API differ by one day. When specifying date ranges in Analytics UI, you
          specify the date range you are interested in (for example, April 1 through April 25).
          </p>
<p class="p">In the Analytics API, however, you need to specify the date range + 1 day. So, for
          the same example, to retrieve analytics for April 1 through 25, in the API you need to
          specify April 1 through April 26. (For details, see <a class="xref" href="../api/analytics_attributes_and_parms.html#analytics_attributes_and_querystring_parms__analytics_date_range">the <var class="keyword varname">date_range</var> attribute</a>.)</p>

    <p class="p"/>

      </li>

  <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Units in Hours</strong>
    <p class="p">Likewise, data involving date/time ranges is returned in increments of an hour, not by
     minute. That is, even if you specify a date/time range that includes a certain minute, the data
     returned are rounded down to the nearest hour.</p>

    <p class="p"/>
</li>

  <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Unidimensional Data</strong><p class="p">In the Analytics UI, for many of the reports, you are shown data
          in multiple dimensions, such as devices by geographical distribution by time (three
          dimensions). </p>
<p class="p">With the Analytics API, however, you might need to make multiple
          requests to acheve the same result. For instance, continuing the example above, you need
          to make one call to retrieve data related to devices and a second call to retrieve data
          related to geographic distribution. </p>
 <p class="p"/>
</li>

   <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Deriving Data</strong>
    <p class="p">For other values, in many cases, the desired values can be derived from the data returned by
     the Analytics API. For example, with the Analytics API you can retrieve the total number of
     unique users for a given time period, but to derive the <em class="ph i">average</em> number of unique users
      <em class="ph i">per day</em>, you need to divide the totals by number of days involved.</p>
