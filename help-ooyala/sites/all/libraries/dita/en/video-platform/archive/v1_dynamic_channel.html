 <h1 class="title topictitle1">Dynamic Channel API (Deprecated)</h1>

 
 
 <div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">Dynamic channels are similar to standard Ooyala channels in that they display a series of videos, but different in that you are giving the player directions on what videos to play as opposed to an explicit list.</p>

  <div class="section">
   <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This software is deprecated. Use the latest version.</div>

   <p class="p">These directions can include labels, ordering information, embed codes, and/or a provider code. All examples are given as query-string parameters to the embed code.
   </p>

   
   <p class="p">Creating Dynamic Channels</p>

   
   <p class="p">
    Basic channel creation requires either an embed code, provider code, or both. When the <samp class="ph codeph">embedCode</samp> is specified, embedCode will take precedence and will be the first video displayed, followed by the other videos from the account given the sorting and ordering information. The simplest form of a dynamic channel is one beginning with a specified video and including all other video available from the account with the default ordering of most recent upload time.
   </p>

   
   Example:
   <p class="p">
    <samp class="ph codeph">
     embedCode=SAMPLE_VIDEO&amp;labels=*
    </samp>
   </p>

   <p class="p">
    A full list of required and optional parameters are listed below along with more detailed examples.
   </p>

   
   
   <p class="p">Signing and Expiration of Dynamic Channels (Required)</p>

   
   <p class="p">Dynamic channels requests require a signature and expiration be added to the query string. Signing can be done in the same way as other API requests with the exception of the date. Instead of using an expiration of seconds since epoch, dynamic channels use an expiration format of YYYYMMDDhhmm.</p>

    <p class="p">
     For example, an expiration of <samp class="ph codeph">201012191844</samp>, represents 2010 December 19, 18:44. </p>

    <p class="p">
     For more details on signature generation please review the Signing section.
    </p>

    <p class="p">Specifying the Embed as a Dynamic Channel (Required)</p>

    
    <p class="p">In order to specify that the embed is a dynamic channel the additional query string parameter <samp class="ph codeph">dynamicChannel=true</samp> must be added to the embed.
    </p>

    <p class="p">Using Labels (Required)</p>

    
    <p class="p">
     Video selection can also be based off of labels:
    </p>

    
    <ul class="ul">
     <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">labels=*</samp> – Includes all live videos in the account. (Excludes channels, channelsets, ads)</li>

     <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">labels=. </samp> – Includes all account content having the same label as the embedCode.</li>

     <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">labels='comma-separated list of URI-escaped labels' </samp> –  Includes all account content matching the label list.</li>

    </ul>

    
    <p class="p">Dynamic Channel Ordering</p>

    
    <p class="p">
     There are several options to order the videos in a channel:
    </p>

    
    <ul class="ul">
     <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">orderBy=uploadTime</samp> – Order lineup by most recently uploaded. (Default)</li>

     <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">orderBy=title</samp> – Order lineup alphabetically by title.</li>

     <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">orderBy=random</samp> – Order lineup randomly each time it is played.</li>

    </ul>

    
    <p class="p">Dynamic Channel Direction</p>

    
    <p class="p">
     There are several options to order the videos in a channel:
    </p>

     <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">orderDirection=asc</samp> – List videos in ascending order. (Default)</li>

      <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">orderDirection=desc</samp> – List videos in descending order.</li>

     </ul>

     
     
     <p class="p">
      Limiting Number of Videos in Dynamic Channels
     </p>

     
     <div class="p">
      <ul class="ul">
       <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">limit</samp> – To specify a maximum number of videos to include in a channel. This defaults to 32 and has a maximum value of 100.</li>

      </ul>

     </div>

     
     <p class="p">Available Channel and Player Parameters</p>

     
     <p class="p">
      Player parameters apply to Dynamic Channels as they do to standard channels:
     </p>

     
     <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">transition</samp> – Specify <samp class="ph codeph">play</samp> to show the next movie or specify <samp class="ph codeph">selector</samp> to show the channel browser after each video in a channel. Default is <samp class="ph codeph">play</samp>. </li>

      <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">view</samp> – Specify whether the initial state of the player is <samp class="ph codeph">normal</samp> (shows the video) or the <samp class="ph codeph">channel</samp>. Default is <samp class="ph codeph">normal</samp>.</li>

      <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">browserPlacement</samp> – For a channel, specify where external controls are placed, either left or right. Can include a percentage or a width in pixels that will be occupied by the controls as in <samp class="ph codeph">left40</samp> for left and 40% of the width, or <samp class="ph codeph">left200px</samp> to specify left and 200 pixels. The default left or right value is 50%.</li>

     </ul>

     <p class="p">
      A full list of available player parameters can be reviewed in the Player API at http://www.ooyala.com/support/docs/player_api#parameters.
     </p>

     
     <p class="p">
      Dynamic Channel Caveats
     </p>

     
     <p class="p">Permissions</p>

     
     <p class="p">To protect the dynamic channel embed code from being misused, any videos included in a dynamic channel must be authorized for the domain the channel is embedded in (or ALL domains) or they will not be displayed.</p>

     
     <p class="p">Analytics</p>

     
     <p class="p">Due to the highly dynamic nature of this type of channel, statistics are included on a per-video basis not on a per-channel basis.</p>

     
     <p class="p">Dynamic Channel Examples</p>

     
     <p class="p">These examples display the query string parameters and values necessary for a dynamic channel. Note that they do not include all parameters like height, width, signature, etc.</p>

     
     <p class="p">For example, to include all videos for the account with the pcode of <samp class="ph codeph">6Fna8C1JRtT8lupf86FFuoIgAD</samp> you would use:</p>

     
     <div class="p">
      <pre class="pre codeblock">
pcode=6Fna8C1JRtT8lupf86FFuoIgAD&amp;labels=*&amp;dynamicChannel=true
</pre>

     </div>

     
     <p class="p">20 most recently uploaded videos:</p>

     <div class="p">
      <pre class="pre codeblock">
pcode=6Fna8C1JRtT8lupf86FFuoIgAD&amp;labels=*&amp;orderBy=UploadTime&amp;orderDirection=desc&amp;limit=20
</pre>

     </div>

     
      <p class="p">Most recently uploaded video per a given label:</p>

      <pre class="pre codeblock">
pcode=6Fna8C1JRtT8lupf86FFuoIgAD&amp;labels=/music/pop&amp;orderBy=uploadTime&amp;orderDirection=desc&amp;dynamicChannel=true&amp;expires=201104200906&amp;signature=34vfYD56fnmJMoGEgnzlb%2BxDoqFy3%2FyQ%2FN6poHYCoI7
</pre>

     
     
     <p class="p">First play a specific video and then all videos with a given label in random order:</p>

     <div class="p">
      <pre class="pre codeblock">
embedCode=E390DSJKn802r2jnksn290&amp;labels=/sports/football&amp;orderBy=random&amp;dynamicChannel=true&amp;expires=201104202222&amp;signature=anytYDyyfnmJMoGEg65poHYlb%2BxDoqCoI7Fy3%2FyQ%2FN6
