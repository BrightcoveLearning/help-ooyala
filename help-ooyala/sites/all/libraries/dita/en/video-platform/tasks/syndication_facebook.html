    <div class="section" id="syndication_facebook__accounts"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">About Syndication</h2>
      
      <p class="p">You can create one or more syndication feeds to automatically publish content to Facebook.
        To authorize Ooyala, you will log in with the appropriate Facebook account, and must then
        grant Ooyala the requested publish and manage permissions. Once authorized, you can specify
        the syndication destination page on Facebook.</p>

      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Previously it was possible to publish videos also to a user's Facebook timeline, events,
        and groups. However, Facebook has recently deprecated the support for these destination
        types and only Facebook pages are currently supported.</div>

      <p class="p">For Facebook syndication (that is, exporting videos to Facebook), Backlot automatically
        uploads the source files of videos directly to Facebook, which handles all transcoding and
        the generation of preview images. Syndication to Facebook is "one-way": your settings and
        content on Backlot are pushed to Facebook, but settings and content on Facebook are
          <em class="ph i">not</em> pulled to Backlot. Facebook requires that syndication feed authorization be
        renewed every 60 days. Admin users for the Backlot account will receive an email alerting
        them to renew their Facebook authorization for the syndication feed prior to the expiry
        date.</p>

      <p class="p">Backlot supports associating a Facebook account with one syndication feed. Likewise, a
        syndication feed can be associated with only one Facebook account at a time. However, you
        can swap out the Facebook account associated with a syndication feed by removing the link
        between it and a Backlot syndication feed, and then authorizing a different Facebook account
        for the syndication feed.</p>

      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> When you syndicate videos to Facebook, each video may be assigned a Facebook video ID.
        The video and its unique ID are linked. You cannot change this ID or give an uploaded video
        a new ID. Changes you make in Backlot to your video metadata (title and description) do not
        have any impact on this video ID.  Only uploading a new video triggers the creation of an
        associated video ID with that asset.</div>

    </div>

    <div class="section" id="syndication_facebook__privacy_settings"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Privacy Settings</h2>
      <p class="p">Videos syndicated to Facebook in Backlot are public in Facebook. However, as usual you can mark videos as public or private within Facebook and Backlot will not override that. Changes
        you make in Backlot to the title or description do not overwrite the Facebook privacy
        setting as we synchronize just these changes with the uploaded video. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="section" id="syndication_facebook__limits"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Limits on Size and Duration of Videos</h2>
      
      <p class="p">There is a limit on the size and duration of videos files that you syndicate to Facebook.
        As required by Facebook, Backlot uploads only video assets that are 1.75 gigabytes or lesser in size and 45 minutes or
        lesser in duration.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section" id="syndication_facebook__labels"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Labels in Facebook Syndication</h2>Syndication to a
      Facebook account allows you to automatically synchronize content in your syndicated channel
      with Facebook. You need to understand how applying labels works with syndication to Facebook
      to avoid potential issues. The following table describes the actions Backlot takes when you
      use labels in the Publish tab, External Publishing subtab. <table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" border="1" class="simpletable"><tr class="sthead">

            associated with the videos is also lost. </td>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"> Choosing Other Facebook Accounts for Syndication </h2>
      
      <p class="p">While Backlot does let you associate a syndication feed with a Facebook account different
        from the one that was used when setting up the feed with another one of your accounts, once
        you do so you cannot modify the original videos that you uploaded to Facebook using the
        previous account. When you switch accounts, all videos uploaded on the previous account stay
        on Facebook but they will be un-managed. These videos (and any new videos) will be uploaded
        separately from Backlot to the other Facebook account and will have new video IDs.</p>

      <p class="p">If you need to associate an existing Backlot syndication to Facebook with one of your other
        accounts:</p>

      <ol class="ol">
        <li class="li">In Backlot open the <span class="ph uicontrol">Publish</span> tab, then the <span class="ph uicontrol">External
            Publishing</span> subtab.</li>

        <li class="li">In <span class="ph uicontrol">Associate Feed with Facebook</span> select <span class="ph uicontrol">Remove
            Authorization</span>. This removes the existing account associated with Facebook in
          Backlot. NOTE: You will see a pop-up message noting that “You will not be able to delete
          or modify videos in your existing Facebook account if you switch to another.”</li>

        <li class="li">Select the syndication that you want to associate with your new Facebook account. </li>

        <li class="li">Click <span class="ph uicontrol">Authorize</span> to associate that syndication with your other
          Facebook account.</li>

      </ol>

    </div>

    <div class="section" id="syndication_facebook__contentreplacement_in_Facebook"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Content Replacement in Facebook Syndication</h2>
      
      <p class="p">Facebook itself is designed
        such that you cannot directly replace the content of a previously uploaded (or syndicated)
        video. Only new video content is assigned a new identifier (Facebook video ID) by Facebook.
        If you want to remove syndicated videos uploaded to Facebook and replace them, you need to
        delete them from within Facebook or use the Backlot remove labels option to delete them. All
        uploaded content will be assigned new Facebook video IDs. </p>

      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Deleting videos automatically removes all titles, descriptions, labels, and analytics
        data associated with the deleted videos.</div>

      <p class="p">For bulk content replacement in a syndication, you must delete the videos in Facebook,
        replace the content in your Backlot syndication, and follow the steps to upload the new
        syndicated assets to Facebook. Each new asset will have a unique Facebook identifier.</p>
