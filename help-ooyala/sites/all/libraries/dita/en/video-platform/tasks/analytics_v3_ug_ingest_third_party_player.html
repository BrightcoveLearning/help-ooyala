    <div class="body taskbody">
        <div class="section context"><p class="p">If you are using a third party player with <span class="ph">Ooyala IQ</span> you can sync your
                content metadata in your <span class="ph">non-Ooyala CMS</span> with the <span class="ph">Ooyala Backlot CMS</span> so that you can identify your videos in
                    <span class="ph">IQ</span>. New metadata can be ingested every 5 minutes.
                Metadata syncing is not required, but recommended if you want to get rich analytics
                with metadata information from IQ. Without syncing your metadata, you will not be
                able to view your video titles in the <span class="ph">IQ</span> user interface (see
                the image below for an example of what this would look like). </p>

            <div class="fig fignone"><img class="image" src="../image/iq_standalone_without_metadata.png" height="234" width="594"/></div>

            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you want to sync your metadata, you must provide <span class="ph">Backlot</span> with an <a class="xref" href="../concepts/chapter_external_ids.html" title="External identifiers enable you to assign custom identifiers to your assets so they are easier to organize, update, and modify. They are sometimes used to correlate with your own internal identifiers."><samp class="ph codeph">external_id</samp></a> for each asset.
                An <samp class="ph codeph">external_id</samp> is a custom identifier for the asset that <span class="ph">Ooyala IQ</span> will use to display asset metadata in the UI. The
                external_id should be the content ID from your CMS so you can map the asset back to
                your CMS. Without an <samp class="ph codeph">external_id</samp> you will not be
                able to see asset metadata in <span class="ph">Ooyala IQ</span>. For MRSS metadata
                syncing, the <samp class="ph codeph">external_id</samp> is provided through the <a class="xref" href="ingestion_ftp_xml.html" title="When ingesting videos, you can use XML manifest files to specify extra metadata (including the video title, description, flight times, labels, and custom metadata), as well as thumbnail and closed caption files. You can use XML manifest files when you ingest content with FTP, Aspera, or MRSS.">XML field
                        <samp class="ph codeph">guid</samp></a>. For remote asset metadata syncing, you must
                associate an <samp class="ph codeph">external_id</samp> in the body of the POST
                request.</div>

            <p class="p">To sync your content metadata in your <span class="ph">non-Ooyala CMS</span> with <span class="ph">Backlot</span>, do one of the following. Note that the video asset is not
                pulled into <span class="ph">Backlot</span>.</p>

                        <samp class="ph codeph">ooyala:remoteasset</samp> tag for metadata-only ingestion. For
                    example, use it to pass the remote asset URL:
