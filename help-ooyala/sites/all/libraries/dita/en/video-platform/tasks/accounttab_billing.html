    ACCOUNT tab to change the information associated with your <span class="ph">Backlot</span>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Updating Your Organization’s Contact Information</strong></p>

      <p class="p">If you want, use this form to provide contact information for the organization associated
        with your Backlot account. Backlot tracks these details for information purposes only - it
        does not affect your account’s Backlot functionality or behavior. Note that this form is
        blank by default.</p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Changing the Timezone</strong></p>

      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Before you change your timezone, contact Ooyala Support to discuss the
        implications.</div>

      <p class="p">Backlot automatically assigns a local timezone based on the address information you
        provided during the signup process. You can use this list to change the local timezone to
        use for your Ooyala account. Changing your timezone does not change the way Ooyala stores
        your data, because dates/times are based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). However, it
        does affect the way Ooyala calculates and displays analytics and reports, which is based on
        your local timezone settings, so a change can result in temporary gaps or double-counting in
        your analytics data.</p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Granting Ooyala Support Engineers with Access to Your Account</strong></p>

      <p class="p">By default, Ooyala support engineers have no access to your account. However, you might
        want to grant Ooyala support engineers permission for temporary access to your Ooyala
        account in order to get their assistance with an issue. Granting access gives them
        admin-level permissions to many (but not all) features. For example, they will not be able
        to view your API key or Secret. Access ends (returns to No Access) when your selected access
        window expires.</p>

      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> “Unlimited” means that access does not expire. It does <em class="ph i">not</em> mean unlimited
        permissions to all functionality.</div>

      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you are locked out of your account and cannot get to this screen to provide access,
        you must provide Ooyala with <em class="ph i">written</em> permission to act on your behalf.</div>
