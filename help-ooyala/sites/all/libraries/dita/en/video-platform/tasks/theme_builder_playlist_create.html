  <div class="section context">
   <div class="p">Playlists are ordered groupings of video content. The video content you include in playlists
    must be completely transcoded. You can build playlists by specific video assets or by label.
     <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
    <ul class="ul">
      
     <li class="li">The maximum number of videos you can add to a
      playlist is 64.</li>

     <li class="li">The maximum number of labels you can associate with a playlist is
      16.</li>

     <li class="li">Allow some time for the playlist you create to be propagated through the Ooyala systems. If you are doing a demonstration, it is best to use playlists you have created previously.</li>

    </ul>
<p class="p"/>

   <p class="p">With playlists you can control the content your viewers can access within a theme. You can
    also organize the content in the playlist. For example, you can create a western theme and fill
    it with a playlist of western movies ordered by release date.</p>

   <p class="p">To create, update, or delete a playlist:</p>

       <div class="p">In the <span class="ph uicontrol">Search</span> text box, enter a search string to
      match against the title, description, or metadata of videos, and hit
      <span class="ph uicontrol">Enter</span>. The following restrictions apply:
      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">The search is not case-sensitive.</li>

        <li class="li">The search string must be at least 3 characters long.</li>

        <li class="li">The special characters <samp class="ph codeph">$</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">^</samp> must be escaped with a
          backslash, like this: <samp class="ph codeph">\$</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">\^</samp>.</li>

        <li class="li">To search for partial (rather than exact) strings in either titles or descriptions (but
            not in metadata), you can use the <samp class="ph codeph">*</samp> wildcard character. For example,
            the string <samp class="ph codeph">Jim*</samp> matches videos with titles or description containing
              <samp class="ph codeph">Jim1</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">JimJam</samp>, or <samp class="ph codeph">Jim99</samp>, but it does
            not match a video with the title <samp class="ph codeph">JamJim</samp>. To match
              <samp class="ph codeph">JamJim</samp>, you can use <samp class="ph codeph">Jam*</samp> or
