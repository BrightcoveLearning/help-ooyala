<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can create a player at any time. Within a player you can enable pods to display your
  playlists.</p>

 
   <div class="p">Players let your viewers watch the content in your themes. You can customize many aspects of a
    player, including but not limited to the following: <ul class="ul">
     <li class="li">controls</li>

     <li class="li">buffer settings</li>

     <li class="li">advertising countdown message</li>

     <li class="li">color theme and highlight color</li>

     <li class="li">scrubber and watermark branding images</li>

    </ul>
</div>

  
   <div class="p">You can also enable and customize pods, which are invisible containers for playlists. Pods can
    contain one or more playlists and can be customized to display playlists in different positions
    with respect to the player. You can create pods and players programmatically or with the Theme
    Builder UI.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> To enable the same custom pod across multiple players with the UI, you must
     manually enable and customize the desired pod for each player. </div>
</div>

   <div class="p">The left panel of the <span class="ph uicontrol">Players</span> tab includes the <span class="ph uicontrol">+</span>
    control to create a new player and is divided into several sections, grouped by types of controls:<div class="fig fignone">

</div>

   <p class="p">To create a player and enable pods:</p>

  
 <ol class="ol">
  <li class="li">
   Log in to Theme Builder.
  </li>

  <li class="li">
   Click the <span class="ph uicontrol">Players</span> tab.
  </li>

  <li class="li">
   In the middle of the left panel, click <span class="ph uicontrol">+</span>.
   <p class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol">Add Player</span> dialog box appears.</p>

  </li>

  <li class="li"> Enter a name for the player and click <span class="ph uicontrol">Save</span>. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The player you see
     displayed as a result is only a sample player, not real content.</div>

  <li class="li">
   Click the <span class="ph uicontrol">Settings</span> submenu and select from the following:
   <ol class="ol" type="a">
    <li class="li">
     To configure the controls to automatically hide when the viewer stops moving the mouse, set <span class="ph uicontrol">Auto-hide controls</span> to <span class="ph uicontrol">ON</span>.
    </li>

    <li class="li">
     To configure the content within this player to continue downloading when the viewer clicks the pause button, set <span class="ph uicontrol">Buffer on pause</span> to <span class="ph uicontrol">ON</span>. This can improve the viewing experience if the viewer has a poor Internet connection. However, if the viewer does not continue watching the content, it can be a waste of bandwidth.
    </li>

    <li class="li"> To display an advertising countdown message that communicates how long the advertisements
      will run before the content starts, set <span class="ph uicontrol">Ad countdown message</span> to
       <span class="ph uicontrol">ON</span>. </li>

   Click the <span class="ph uicontrol">Controls</span> submenu and select from the following:

    <li class="li">
     To provide volume controls to the viewer, set <span class="ph uicontrol">Volume controls (desktop only)</span> to <span class="ph uicontrol">ON</span>.

    <li class="li">
     To enable the viewer to change the bit rate at which the video is displayed, set
        <span class="ph uicontrol">Bitrate selector</span> to <span class="ph uicontrol">ON</span>. When enabled, the
       viewer can select among Low (the lowest bit rate for the video), Medium (the middle bit
       rate), and High (the highest bit rate available). Because videos are usually delivered via
       adaptive bit rate (ABR) and Ooyala automatically selects the optimal bit rate available for
       the connection, we recommend setting this to <span class="ph uicontrol">OFF</span>.
    </li>

    <li class="li">
     To enable closed captions, from the <span class="ph uicontrol">Closed captions</span> list box,
       select the desired language or <span class="ph uicontrol">None</span>. During playback, if no closed
       captions are available for the video, the closed captions option is not displayed.
