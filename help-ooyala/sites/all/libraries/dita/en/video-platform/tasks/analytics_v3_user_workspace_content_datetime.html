        <div class="section context"> When you first access the <span class="ph uicontrol">Business Intelligence</span> page the
            date range of the data is set for the current day. With the date selection tool in the
            upper left you can set the date ranges for all data displayed on the <span class="ph uicontrol">Business
                Intelligence</span> page. <div class="fig fignone">

            </div>
On the <span class="ph uicontrol">Business Intelligence</span> and <span class="ph uicontrol">Video
                Details</span> pages you can specify time segments to view, including the
            following: <div class="fig fignone">
                <img class="image" id="task_ez3_bx5_pl__image_f14_tfq_bn" src="../image/analytics_v3_user_content_timesegments.png"/>
            </div>
For day, week, and month time segments, you can select specific dates up to 37
            months in range or use presets for relative date ranges. For 15 minute and hour time
            segments you can select specific dates and times up to 7 days in range.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The maximum
                date you can select is the current date in the provider's time zone. This may appear
                as the future or past if you are looking at the IQ interface in a different time
                zone than the provider's time zone.</div>

            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p">The default date range for the day time segment is different from the default date range for the 15 minute and hour time segments.</p>

            <p class="p">For the day time segment the default date range is from 12:00am of the first day to 11:59pm of the last day in the week (8 24 hour segments). For the 15 minute and hour time segments the default date range is from 12:00pm of the first day to 12:00pm of the last day in the week (7 24 hour segments).</p>

            <p class="p">This difference in default date range means that your metric data will change when
               you switch between the day time segment and the 15 minute or hour time segments. We
               will change the date range limitation for 15 minute and hour time segments to match
               the day time range (8 24 hour segments) in an upcoming release.</p>
