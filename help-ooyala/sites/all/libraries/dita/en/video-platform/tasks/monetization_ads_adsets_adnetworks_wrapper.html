    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Working with Your Own Ad Assets, Ad Sets, and Ad Sources</h1>

    
    <div class="body taskbody"><p class="shortdesc">This material includes how to create ad sets in <span class="ph">Backlot</span>
        and how to integrate with ad sources.</p>

        <div class="section context" id="task_wlz_nm4_zh__adnetworkgeneralprocess">
            <p class="p"> Ads can come from a variety of sources, such as from your own assets on <span class="ph">Backlot</span> or from other ad sources. The term <dfn class="term">ad
                    source</dfn> refers to any system that returns a valid ad response, including
                ad servers and ad managers, as well as ad networks and exchanges. </p>

            <p class="p">You can create as many ad sets as you like, but each player will work with only one
                ad set. You can assign any number of ad tags and ad sets programmatically on your
                webpage as long as each of them is assigned to different players on the same
                webpage. </p>

            <p class="p">The general process for working with ad sets is as follows.</p>

            <ol class="ol">
                <li class="li">If you are working with your own ads, get your video file(s) in order to upload
                    to <span class="ph">Backlot</span>.</li>

                <li class="li">If you are working with an ad source partner, get configuration details from
                    them, such as identifying keys, codes, or passwords. You need these details to
                    configure Backlot.</li>

                <li class="li">In <span class="ph">Backlot</span>, create an ad set for your own material
                    or for each ad source partner, relying on the configuration details you obtained
                    above.</li>

                <li class="li">Associate the ad set with an asset.</li>

                <li class="li">At run time, if desired, pass ad-source-specific parameters to the ad source,
                    for targeting or other needs. For further information on ad parameters, see
                        <a class="xref" href="../reference/player_v3_dev_adsparams.html" title="Customize ads using embedded parameters.">Ads
                        Embedded Parameter Overview</a>.</li>

            </ol>

            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> For Ooyala Backlot-hosted ads (ad source set to "My Ads"), in-stream and mid-roll
                ads are not currently supported. Do not select "In-Stream" or "mid-roll" as an ad
                position for ad sets with Ad Source set to "My Ads."</div>
