            <p class="p">In addition to many infrastructural improvements to performance and stability, this release provides the following added feature:</p>

            
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Easy Encoding Location Migration</strong> Previously, in order to change the
                    encoder region of a channel, you had to create a new channel. With this release,
                    you can contact your Brightcove Technical Support and quickly change the encoder
                    region of a channel to another one of the same type. This means that if you are
                    having connection issues to the encoder region, Brightcove Technical Support can
                    simply stop the channel and move it to a different encoder region. If you have
                    lost access to a Tokyo encoder region, you can quickly change the channel to use
                    a Seoul encoder region instead. Contact your Ooyala account manager help setting
                    up this new capability.</li>

<strong class="ph b">Segment
                snapping when trimming Live to VOD</strong>
            <p class="p">For customers editing live streaming content for VOD, previously, when a Live to VOD
                video was trimmed, the UI let them set trim values to the second. This gave the
                impression that the VOD platform would accept trim values to that accuracy, which it
                does not. Now, trimming snaps to the segment boundaries of the associated Live
                channel's encoding profile. This new feature is automatically applied when you trim
                video content. </p>
<p class="p">To modify a channel's encoding profile (often 6 or 10
                seconds), contact Ooyala Support. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Notifications Improvement </strong></p>
<p class="p">For
                monitoring their channels for alerts on channels with Ooyala Encode and Ooyala
                Package, Ooyala Live has a new channel status called 'alerting'. This status is
                activated when there are any alert conditions. This new feature is automatically
                applied. You do not need to modify a channel's profile. </p>
<p class="p"><img class="image" src="image/live_channel_alerts.png" alt="Ooyala Live Notifications"/></p>
<p class="p">Alerts
                are captured from Encoder and Packager and displayed in the notifications area. When
                the alert is resolved (automatically or by human intervention) the channel returns
                to 'running' state.</p>
<p class="p">Typical alert conditions could include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Problems with Encoder input or output</li>

                <li class="li">Problems with Packager input or output</li>

            </ul>
<p class="p">This feature facilitates improved debugging. Further debugging information has
                also been added to email notifications. In case of an issue, provide the debugging
                information in the email to Ooyala Support. </p>

                        <p class="p">As with any platform, Ooyala Pulse maintains a specific capacity at any
                            given time. Once the max limit of ad requests per second is reached, ads
                            might not be returned during ad breaks to viewers.</p>

                        <p class="p">Prefetching makes those requests in advance helping to prevent your ads
                            from bottle-necking during high-capacity periods. Ooyala Live holds
                            those requests for a rolling 20 minutes, and then schedules a new
                            pre-fetch.</p>

                        <p class="p">Prefetching is only available in Personalized Ad mode. A channel that
                            does not use personalized ads cannot be changed to a personalized ad
                            channel.</p>

                        <p class="p">For channels using Personalized ads that you have already created, you
                            need to turn prefetching ON to use prefetching.</p>

                        <p class="p">To turn on prefetching:</p>

                                have a large number of consumers on your steaming channel.</li>

                        search for log information based on various criteria. Currently, this API
                        gives users the ability to filter ingestion log information by time period
                        (basic and manifest-based users) or status (manifest-based user only). In
                        the future, the API can be expanded to allow additional filtering
