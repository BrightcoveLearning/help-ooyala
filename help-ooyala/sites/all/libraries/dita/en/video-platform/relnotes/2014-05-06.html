<strong class="ph b">Backlot Syndication to YouTube</strong><p class="p">Ooyala now supports YouTube
                Channels and Channel Managers. We also support syndicating content to YouTube
                through an OAuth2 mechanism instead of username and password credentials. OAuth2 is
                the latest standard to authorize integrations between systems. If you have granted
                an application on your mobile devices or desktop access to a Google, YouTube or
                Facebook account, you have used OAuth2. </p>

            mandated by FCC to allow end users to easily manipulate how closed captions are rendered
            on the player.  <p class="p">The FCC mandate currently applies to full length programming that was
                previously aired on television with captions. More details on content coverage can
                be found in the article, <a class="xref" href="http://www.fcc.gov/guides/captioning-internet-video-programming" target="_blank">Captioning of Internet Video

<p class="p">Ooyala now offers out-of-the-box FCC 708 compliance for
                all video content that contains a closed captions file or cue point in-stream
                captions, thus making this feature available for all customers. </p>
