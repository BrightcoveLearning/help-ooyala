            <p class="p">The features below apply both to <strong class="ph b">Live</strong> content types as well as <strong class="ph b">Video-on-Demand</strong> content types.</p>

            <div class="sectiondiv">
                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Dashboard</strong></p>

                <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">The overall <strong class="ph b">Concurrent User Trending</strong> chart across your entire account can be seen at one-minute granularity level
                        when login takes place.
                        The Concurrent User Trending view presents a snapshot at a given moment.  The view is updated at each one-minute interval.
                        <ul class="ul">
                            <li class="li">You can select one asset from the <strong class="ph b">Popular Now</strong> window or from the <strong class="ph b">Trending Past Hour</strong> window,
                                and see Concurrent User Trending for each asset.</li>

                            <li class="li">This <em class="ph i">Trending</em> chart is a dynamic, moving chart that spans
                                from the current moment back to four hours ago.  It is updated in real time.</li>

                            <li class="li">You can zoom in and out of the chart.</li>

                            <li class="li">You can get the peak concurrent user in the chart.</li>

                        </ul>

            <div class="sectiondiv">
                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Business Intelligence</strong></p>

                <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">Business Intelligence Board</strong> end-to-end latency has been reduced to 90 minutes.</li>

                    <li class="li">You can go to the <strong class="ph b">Reach</strong> tab and see concurrent user historical data.</li>

                    <li class="li">You can pick any time window, from a minimum of 15 minutes to maximum of 2 days, to see the trending of concurrent users.
                        For example, if you select 03/30/16 12:00pm to 03/30/16 12:15pm, you will get data points for 12:00pm, 12:14pm.</li>

                    <li class="li">You can get one-minute data granularity for concurrent user metrics for your overall account, as well as each asset.
                        You can filter by multiple video assets, with an upper limit of 50. 
                    </li>

                    <li class="li">You can get the peak concurrent user in the Concurrent Trending chart.</li>

                    <li class="li">You can view the <em class="ph i">average concurrent user per minute</em> in the lefthand panel.</li>

                </ul>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Note</strong>: No other dimensional breakdown for concurrent user (device, geo, etc.) is supported currently. This means that there is no filter capability for these dimensions.
                    When the user is in one-minute concurrent user view, all filters other than <em class="ph i">asset</em> are disabled.
                    Likewise, when a filter other than <em class="ph i">asset</em> is applied, one-minute granularity is disabled.
                </p>

                <p class="p">
                    <strong class="ph b">Note</strong>: Concurrent user metrics can only be shown at the one-minute granularity level.
                        If you change the granularity to another value, like fifteen minutes, one hour, etc.,
                        the view will automatically switch to show unique users.
