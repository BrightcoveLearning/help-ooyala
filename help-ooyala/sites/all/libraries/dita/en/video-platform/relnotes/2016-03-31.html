<p class="p">The Category API allows you to group assets according to the concurrent stream limits
                required by a studio or other content owner. You create a category for a studio, set the limit
                of concurrent streams allowed by that studio, then assign specific assets to the category.
                Actions taken on categories do not change any of the attributes associated with the assets
                within the category, it only changes their categorization. Use the Backlot API to work with
                categories of movies. Use the Rights Locker API to set limits on the categories for a specific
                user. All category routes are authenticated prior to allowing access. See <a class="xref" href="../concepts/player_v3_category_limits.html" title="The Category API allows you to group assets into categories according to the concurrent stream limits required by a studio or other content owner.
