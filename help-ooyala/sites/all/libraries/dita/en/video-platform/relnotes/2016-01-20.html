                                invalid ID3 results were returned. This issue has been resolved, and
                                warnings are now logged in such cases.</p>

                            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Known Issues</strong></p>

                            <p class="p">There is an issue in which closed captions may be pushed off the

                                    <li class="li">When a sender app would disconnect implicitly (e.g. the
                                        sender device battery dies, the sender device Wi-Fi network
                                        drops), it would remove the Chromecast controls and
                                        notifications from the sender device. This issue has been
                                        resolved, and the sender app now keeps track of implicit
                                        disconnections and attempt to reconnect to a receiver when
                                        the sender app is reopened.</li>
