            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Discovery Insights in Ooyala IQ</strong></p>
<p class="p">We are excited to announce new Discovery Insights functionality that is available as of today,
                October 15th, 2015. As an Ooyala Discovery user, if you are already benefiting from
                personalized video recommendations and receiving insights into engagement growth
                that are currently delivered as email reports, you will love the new and improved
                Discovery Insights, now available as part of Ooyala IQ.</p>
<p class="p">Look for the Discovery tab inside the Business Intelligence page in Ooyala IQ and enjoy access to
                17 new KPIs that give you an in-depth view of engagement growth and content
                performance. For example, the Discovery End Screen CTR (click-through rate) metric
                tells you the percentage of Discovery end screen recommendations that led to an
                additional play. You can also see the number of times each asset in your catalog was
                recommended and played via Discovery.</p>
 <p class="p">For details on
                    how to view these metrics in Ooyala IQ, see the Discovery Insights tutorial video (available at <span class="ph">Ooyala <a class="xref" href="http://help-ooyala.brightcove.com/video-tutorials" target="_blank">Video Tutorials</a></span>) or read
