    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Notable changes for this release include new third-party player reporting
        functionality in Ooyala IQ and a new Community login process.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Software Feature Releases</h2>
            
            <div class="sectiondiv">
                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">New Third-Party Player Reporting Feature in Ooyala IQ</strong></p>

                <p class="p">You can now integrate <span class="ph">Ooyala</span> analytics (Ooyala
                IQ) with any third-party system (non-<span class="ph">Ooyala</span> video players). </p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">UI Adjustments</strong></p>

                <div class="p">The <span class="ph">Ooyala IQ</span> UI has been adjusted to
                accommodate third-party player analytics. The adjustments include the following: <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">The <em class="ph i">Player</em> panel shows the third-party player name
                        when events come from a third-party player. For example, if you analyze
                        events coming from JW player, you will see "JW Player" in the <em class="ph i">Player</em> panel. </li>

                    <li class="li">If content metadata is not ingested into Backlot, Ooyala IQ provides
                        graceful UI degradation. This means that Ooyala IQ can provide analytics for
                        third-party player events without requiring metadata ingestion from a
                        third-party CMS system. For example, if Ooyala IQ doesn't get a video
                        asset's title metadata, it will use the video asset's external ID in place
                        of the title (see image below for an example). <div class="fig fignone">
                            <img class="image" src="../image/iq_standalone_without_metadata.png" height="175" width="445"/>
                        </div>

                    </li>

                    <li class="li"><span class="ph">If you are using Ooyala players and third-party players to
                        play Ooyala video assets (hosted in Backlot), you can now use one Backlot
                        account to stream video to an Ooyala player and a third-party player. You
                        can view consolidated IQ analytics metrics in one dashboard (through one
                        user account) for both types of players.</span>You
                        can see the different metrics for your Ooyala players and third-party
                        players by looking at the Player and Device panels. Please note that for
                        third-party assets (hosted in a third-party CMS), you will still need to set
                        up a separate Backlot provider account to ingest asset metadata.</li>

                </ul>

            </div>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Metadata Synch</strong></p>

                <p class="p">You can synch your third-party metadata with Backlot and Ooyala IQ via the
                    Backlot API. See <a class="xref" href="../tasks/analytics_v3_ug_ingest_third_party_player.html">Syncing Third-Party Metadata with Ooyala IQ</a> for details. </p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Backlot Account Management</strong></p>

                <div class="p">You will have a unique Backlot account for your third-party player analytics
                    accounts. We have made several modifications to make the Backlot UI more user
                    friendly for customers who use Ooyala IQ in a standalone fashion, including: <ul class="ul">
                        <li class="li">In the MANAGE tab, we have removed the Embed, Monetize, Publishing
                            rules, Custom Metadata, and Encodings sub-tabs.</li>

                        <li class="li">In the MANAGE tab Details sub-tab, we have removed the Closed Captions,
                            Published To, and Content Replacement sections. </li>

                        <li class="li">In the main Backlot panel, we have removed the Pause button and Size
                            columns.</li>

                        <li class="li">In the asset Status section, only Live and Recently created are
                            available.</li>

                        <li class="li">In the left panel under content types, only Remote Asset and YouTube
                            Video are available.</li>

                        <li class="li">In the ACCOUNT tab, the Account Settings and User Management sub-tabs
                            are available.</li>

                        <li class="li">In the ACCOUNT tab User Management sub-tab, the API Secret key is
                            available.</li>

                        <li class="li">In the ACCOUNT tab, Admin, Manager, Read-Only, and Analytics Only user
                            roles are supported.</li>

                    </ul>

                </div>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">New JavaScript SDK</strong></p>

                <p class="p">We've created a JavaScript SDK that communicates your third-party player's events
                    to Ooyala IQ. To integrate with the JavaScript SDK, you need to use an adapter
                    that translates your player's events and APIs to correlate with the events
                    defined in the Ooyala JavaScript SDK.</p>

                <p class="p">You can use an Ooyala adapter or create your own adapter.</p>

                <p class="p">For details on integrating with existing adapters and creating your own adapters,
                    see <a class="xref" href="../tasks/analytics_v3_integrate_javascriptsdk.html">Integrating Third-Party Players with IQ Using the JS SDK</a>.</p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Getting Started</strong></p>

                <div class="p" id="release20151202__use_standalone">To use this new functionality, do the following: <ol class="ol">
                        <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="../concepts/analytics_v3_ug_third_party_players.html">Ask your account manager to create a new provider
                                account</a> with third-party player reporting functionality.</li>

                            and Backlot.</li>

                        <li class="li">Use the new <a class="xref" href="../tasks/analytics_v3_integrate_javascriptsdk.html">Ooyala IQ JavaScript SDK</a> to integrate your

                            point of contact if you want to work with Ooyala Professional Services
                            for this step.</li>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Community Update</h2>
            
            <p class="p">In an effort to make the Ooyala Community more open and accessible, we have
                implemented a new login system utilizing the Lithium platform for sign-on. This
                change will only be noticeable to existing Community members active before 12/2/15.
                In the past, the Community sign-in was tied to your Backlot account. To access the
                Community, members active before 12/2/15 will need to generate a new password. For
                details on this process, see <a class="xref" href="http://community.ooyala.com/t5/Ooyala-Blog/New-Community-quot-Sign-in-quot-coming-soon/ba-p/7821" target="_blank">http://community.ooyala.com/t5/Ooyala-Blog/New-Community-quot-Sign-in-quot-coming-soon/ba-p/7821</a>.</p>
