            <div class="sectiondiv">
                <p class="p">This release of Player V4 includes fixes for the following bugs:</p>

                <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">On Mac devices using Safari, the Discovery tray was misaligned. This issue
                        is resolved.</li>

                    <li class="li">When using the Safari browser, the Up Next title text was overlapping the
                        description. This issue is resolved. </li>

                    <li class="li">On iOS devices using Google IMA ads on a Player enabled for Discovery, after
                        starting a Discovery video, Google IMA ads only played with audio (no
                        video). This issue has been resolved for iPad devices. Discovery is not
                        supported on iPhone devices.</li>

                    <li class="li">On iPad devices, when multiple V4 players were embedded on the same page,
                        only one player would play successfully (additional players would not play
                        even after you paused the first video). This issue has been resolved so that
                        you can have multiple players on iPad devices, play the first video, pause
                        the first video (or watch to the end) and successfully play videos from
                        another player afterward. Please note that there is a known limitation that
                        iOS that only allows a single media to play at a given time (you cannot play
                        multiple videos at the same time).</li>
