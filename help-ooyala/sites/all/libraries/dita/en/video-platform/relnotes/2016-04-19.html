                    <li class="li">The <samp class="ph codeph">PlayerInfo</samp> API has been enhanced. This class provides

                        call <samp class="ph codeph">StreamPlayer.setPlayerInfo()</samp>. Now you call
                            <samp class="ph codeph">Options.Builder.setPlayerInfo()</samp> and pass a
                            <samp class="ph codeph">PlayerInfo</samp> object.</li>

                    <li class="li">For SecurePlayer Integrations, you are now required to set the

                            <samp class="ph codeph">VisualOnConfiguration</samp>. Video will not be able to play
                        back unless this parameter is set. If you are not sure what to set, please
                        contact your CSM.</li>
