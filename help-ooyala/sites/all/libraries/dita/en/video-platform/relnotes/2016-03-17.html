                    <li class="li">The <a class="xref" href="https://docs.brightcove.com/apidocs-ooyala/live_api/index.html" target="_blank">Ooyala Live REST API Reference</a> is now available.
                        This will allow external services to perform create, read update, delete
                        (CRUD) actions for events, channels and schedules.</li>

                    <li class="li">Support has been added for eHLS with a key rotation option.</li>

                    <li class="li">Support has been added for multiple network inputs for a single channel,
                        providing input redundancy.</li>

                    <li class="li">Channel stream versioning is now available, allowing you to use multiple
                        encoders at different times but for the same channel.</li>

                    <li class="li">Every time a channel is started it fetches the profile data. This allows you
                        to update the profile for a channel without creating a new one. This applies
                        to all channels created with Ooyala Live v.1.1.0 and later.</li>

                        and improved look and feel.</li>

                    <li class="li">The 2GB file size limitation has been changed to 9 EB.</li>

                    <li class="li">There was an issue in which DVR duration for events set by users was not
                        propagating correctly. This issue has been resolved.</li>

                    <li class="li">Event lengths have a 4-hour maximum if Live to VOD enabled, and are limited

                <li class="li"> The OoyalaPlayer now uses the new <samp class="ph codeph">OoyalaNotification</samp> class in
                        <samp class="ph codeph">Observable</samp> events, which work differently than in the past.
                    Previously, the OoyalaPlayer would emit <samp class="ph codeph">String</samp> objects from the
                    OoyalaPlayer's Observer Notifications:
                        <pre class="pre codeblock">public void update(Observable arg0, Object argN){ ... }</pre>
<p class="p">In
                        such cases, <samp class="ph codeph">argN</samp> was a <samp class="ph codeph">String</samp>. This has
                        changed, and <samp class="ph codeph">argN</samp> is now an object of type
                            <samp class="ph codeph">OoyalaNotification</samp>. If you would like to maintain the
                        same functionality you have had with strings up till now, you can now use
                            <samp class="ph codeph">OoyalaNotifcation.getNameOrUnknown(argN)</samp>, which returns
                        the string that was originally
                    passed:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock">public void update(Observable arg0, Object argN) {
    if (arg0 != player) {
      return;
    }

    final String arg1 = OoyalaNotification.getNameOrUnknown(argN);
    if (arg1 == OoyalaPlayer.TIME_CHANGED_NOTIFICATION_NAME) {
      ... your code here ...
    }
    ...
}        </pre>
