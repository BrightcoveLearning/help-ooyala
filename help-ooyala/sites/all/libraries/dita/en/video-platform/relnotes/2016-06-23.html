                    <li class="li">There was an issue in which seeking to the end of playback with the
                        ExoPlayerSampleApp when there was a midroll ad would occasionally cause the
                        app to crash or freeze. This issue has been resolved.</li>

                    <li class="li">There was an issue in which there were difficulties in getting the Ooyala
                        Skin SDK scrubber bar to respond to touch when seeking. This issue has been
                        resolved.</li>

                            <li class="li">An <span class="keyword apiname">AdPodEnded</span> event signifies the end of ads and

<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Known Issues</strong></p>
<div class="p">There is a bug in React Native that manifests as a
                memory leak in Android applications. We are investigating this issue, however, if
                you want to work around this issue you can do the following: <ol class="ol" id="release20160623__ol_wvd_ctv_jw">
                    <li class="li">In your application's Skin.json, set "startScreen" -&gt; "showPromo":
                        true".</li>

                    <li class="li">In your application's Playback activity, when you create an Options Object,
                        call OptionsBuilder.setShowPromoImage(true).</li>

                </ol>
This will use the legacy Ooyala Promo image feature, so you will still have a
                promo image while avoiding the memory leak.</div>
