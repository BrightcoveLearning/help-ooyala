            <p class="p">Ooyala's support for VAST on the iOS and Android mobile SDKs for Player v3 has recently changed the way ad impressions are tracked in Ooyala Pulse. For podded ad sets like mid-roll ads, impressions are tracked when each individual ad in a podded ad set has started to play. This gives you a more accurate view of ad impressions tracked for sessions played through the Ooyala Player via iOS and Android applications.</p>
