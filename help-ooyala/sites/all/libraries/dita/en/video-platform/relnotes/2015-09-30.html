                Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled. Set up CORS enablement on the CDN you
                use for content serving. For information on how to enable CORS, see <a class="xref" href="http://enable-cors.org/" target="_blank">http://enable-cors.org/</a>. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> These CORS prerequisites do not apply if
