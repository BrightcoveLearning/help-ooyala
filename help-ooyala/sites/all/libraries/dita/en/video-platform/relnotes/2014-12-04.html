        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Google IMA Migration</h2>
             We are deprecating and deactivating versions of the
            Google IMA SDK prior to IMA3. <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Deactivation of deprecated Google IMA SDKs</strong></p>

            The current supported IMA SDK version is IMA3 for both Flash and HTML5. The IMA2 Flash
            and IMA1 HTML5 SDKs not only do not support the current full DFP and AdX feature set,
            but are also officially deprecated and no longer actively maintained or supported by
            Google's engineering team. As such, the IMA2 and IMA1 SDKs are no longer recommended for
            use by any publishers. After 12/31, the IMA2 and IMA1 SDKs are planned to be fully
            deactivated; Google will remove the IMA2 and IMA1 SDK files from hosting, and all
            players integrated with the deactivated SDKs will cease to request or render ads. To
            continue serving ads uninterrupted, all players with IMA2 Flash or IMA1 HTML5 SDK must
            be upgraded to IMA3 SDK prior to the deactivation date. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This does not affect the
                HTML5 player and Ooyala iOS and Android SDK apps.</div>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Where is IMA SDK version assigned?</strong></p>
 The version of IMA SDK integrated with
            players is determined by the following settings in Backlot. <p class="p">Backlot → MONETIZE → Ad
                Sets → Ad Source.</p>
 An older version of IMA SDK is loaded on the Flash and HTML5
            players when the following Ad Sources under Ad Sets is selected in Backlot: <ol class="ol">
                <li class="li">DoubleClick</li>

                <li class="li">DoubleClick Overlay</li>

                <li class="li">AdSense For Video Instream</li>

                <li class="li">AdSense For Video Endcap</li>

                <li class="li">AdSense For Video Overlay</li>

            </ol>
 The correct version, IMA SDK3, is loaded on the players when the following Ad
            Source under Ad Sets is selected in Backlot: <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Google IMA V3</li>

            </ul>
 DoubleClick and AdSense ads will still be supported via the Google IMA V3 Ad
            Source using the ad tag. <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">How to change IMA SDK to latest version?</strong></p>
 Please
            contact your Customer Success Manager and Brightcove Technical Support for migration
            instructions. You need to migrate all of your Ad Sets to use the latest and correct Ad
            Source, Google IMA V3, to avoid playback problems from using deprecated or non-supported
            versions of Google IMA. <p class="p"> This migration cannot be done programmatically on the player
                because we will not be able to test or validate all customer specific integrations
                and edge cases. The player is designed to automatically load the latest IMA V3 SDK.
                However the setting via Ad Sets in Backlot overrides the player version. Hence, the
                change needs to be made on Backlot to ensure that correct version of IMA module is
                loaded on the players. </p>
<p class="p"> Our recommendation is for you to work with Technical
                Support to make the switch on a test player, verify the change across their ad sets
                and ad rules, and then make the switch to the correct Ad Source in production. The
                Technical Support team will be able to help migrate large ad sets for customers.
                This process is automated to ensure accuracy and efficiency. </p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Other Deprecations</strong></p>
 We no longer support cuepoints for Google IMA. <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Ad
                    Rules for Flash</strong></p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Ad rules are only available for Flash.</div>
 You
            can set ad positions for Google IMA though DFP ad rules, which can be enabled to
            correctly render for an ad with the <a class="xref" href="../reference/adset_fields_google.html" title="The fields described here are for Backlot ad sets with ad source set to Google IMA V3.">Backlot UI</a> or <a class="xref" href="../api/ad_sets.html" title="Ad sets are ad configurations that control the ad experience of an asset during playback.">Backlot API</a>.

            to integrate with DFP can be found at <a class="xref" href="../concepts/monetization_dfp.html" title="You can synch your Ooyala-hosted content with DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) via either the Backlot API or an MRSS feed so you can monetize it with Google IMA.">Monetizing Your Ooyala Content with DFP</a>
