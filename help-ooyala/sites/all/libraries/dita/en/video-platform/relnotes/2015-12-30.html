        of the mobile SDKs for iOS and Android v.4.9.0.</p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Ooyala Live</strong></p>

                <p class="p">We are pleased to announce major updates to Ooyala Live. Ooyala now offers a self
                    service portal that enables you to quickly setup and deliver TV channels, Live
                    TV channels, as well as live ad-hoc and scheduled events with live-to-VOD
                    recordings.</p>

                <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">Benefits</strong>
                    <ul class="ul">
                        <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Full Control</strong>: With its single administrative console, Ooyala Live
                            drastically reduces the time it takes to provision, program and
                            distribute a channel globally. In addition to enabling live-to-VOD
                            conversion with DVR capabilities, Ooyala Live manages the channel/event
                            provisioning pipeline including transcoding, packaging, content
                            encryption/protection and monitoring of the linear stream or events’
                            health.</li>

                        <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">End-to-end Platform Support</strong>: Fully integrated with Ooyala’s
                            Backlot CMS, you can realize the full benefits of superior content
                            management, video playback, delivery, syndication, content discovery,
                            video recommendations and monetization tools, as well as industry
                            leading analytics from Ooyala IQ and flawless playback.</li>

                        <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Active Monitoring</strong>: With active monitoring of your stream,
                            seamless live-to-VOD, and the use of a single Content ID to aggregate
                            analytics, Ooyala Live gives you immediate notifications and alerts from
                            the entire end to end video stream — including live stream telemetry
                            data.</li>

                    </ul>

                </div>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Accessing Live</strong></p>

                <p class="p">In order to use the Live portal you must have a Ooyala Backlot account. The
                    account must have remote assets and EPG enabled in the package. </p>

                <p class="p">For information on establishing a Ooyala Live account, contact your account
                    manager.</p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Known Issues</strong></p>

                <p class="p">The DVR functionality for HDS streams for a Live event does not work in Live 1.0.
                    HLS Streams work for Live Events. However, once the event is done, and if an
                    archive flag is enabled, DVR will be available for the VOD asset created. DVR
                    functionality does work as expected for Live Channels. </p>

            <div class="sectiondiv">
                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Chromecast Integration v.2.0</strong></p>

                <p class="p">We are upgrading our existing Chromecast Integration. The upgraded implementation
                    provides support for new features, including support for multiple streaming
                    protocols and other playback features. </p>

                <p class="p">The Ooyala Chromecast Integration v.2.0 includes sample sender and receiver
                    applications that you can integrate with easily to go to market with Chromecast
                    streaming capabilities for your content libraries. You can customize the sample
                    applications and/or selectively use the Ooyala sender or receiver applications
                    with your own sender and receiver applications. You can find sample sender
                    applications for <a class="xref" href="https://github.com/ooyala/ios-sample-apps/tree/stable/ChromecastSampleApp" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a class="xref" href="https://github.com/ooyala/android-sample-apps/tree/stable/ChromecastSampleApp" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a class="xref" href="https://github.com/ooyala/chromecast-sample-receiver" target="_blank">sample receiver applications</a> on Ooyala's
                    public GitHub repository.</p>

                <p class="p">The following is a known issue for the Chromecast Integration v.2.0. In the scenario when a user plays a video on a mobile device and is casting to a Chromecast, analytics are updated and are displayed in Ooyala IQ as 2 displays and 2 plays requested for each asset The personal device and Chromecast device are each counted as a device by Ooyala IQ for the play and cast scenario.</p>

                <p class="p">For more details on the Chromecast integration, see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/chromecast_and_ooyala.html">Chromecast and Ooyala (Deprecated)</a>. Full
                    integration and customization documentation will be available in January 2016.

            <div class="sectiondiv">
                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Mobile SDK for Android v.4.9.0</strong></p>

                <div class="p">The following features were added in this release: <ul class="ul">
                        <li class="li">Added Discovery API support in OoyalaPlayer.</li>

                        <li class="li">Added additional logging around errors.</li>

                        <li class="li">Updated the Secureplayer Libraries to 03_05_02_0001. </li>

                    </ul>
</div>

                <p class="p">This release also includes a fix for a bug where setEmbedCodes() did not work
                    correctly.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="sectiondiv">
                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Mobile SDK for iOS v.4.9.0</strong></p>

                <p class="p">This release includes the fix for a bug where Live Streams sometimes would not
                    show Live UI elements.</p>

            <div class="sectiondiv">
                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Windows 10 Certification</strong></p>
 Ooyala's V3 HTML5 and Flash players are now
                certified for Windows 10. <p class="p">The following is an intermittent known issue for Flash.
                    For Flash players using Windows 10 Edge, a LiveRail pre-roll ad pauses when the
                    user clicks the ad. In fullscreen mode, clickthrough behavior exits fullscreen
                    as expected, but sometimes no clickthrough page/tab is opened. This behavior is
                    native to the LiveRail plugin and any modifications to current and existing
                    behavior will have to be owned and modified by LiveRail. </p>

                <p class="p">You can now ingest closed caption files using XML metadata and CSV metadata via
                    FTP. Previously, the only way to do this was via the Backlot UI.</p>

                    this was via the Backlot UI or Backlot API.</p>
