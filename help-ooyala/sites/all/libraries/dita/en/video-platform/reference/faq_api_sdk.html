            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Where are the latest versions of the SkinSDK for iOS and Android?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Download the latest Android SkinSDK at <a class="xref" href="http://static.ooyala.com.s3.amazonaws.com/sdk/android/release/OoyalaSkinSDK-Android.zip" target="_blank">http://static.ooyala.com.s3.amazonaws.com/sdk/android/release/OoyalaSkinSDK-Android.zip</a> and the latest iOS SkinSDK at <a class="xref" href="http://static.ooyala.com.s3.amazonaws.com/sdk/ios/release/OoyalaSkinSDK-iOS.zip" target="_blank">http://static.ooyala.com.s3.amazonaws.com/sdk/ios/release/OoyalaSkinSDK-iOS.zip</a>.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What's new in this release for the mobile SDKs for iOS and Android?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> For this release, the mobile SDKs for iOS and Android have a completely
                rebuilt user interface that aligns perfectly (when reasonable) with the HTML5 player
                user interface. See <a class="xref" href="../concepts/pbv4_components.html">User Interface for the Player V4 Skin</a>.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What can I configure in this new interface?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> You can adjust the player user interface settings (see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/pbv4_customize.html">Customizing the Player V4 Appearance</a>) by
                modifying the file skin.json. You can use the same skin.json file for your HTML5,
                iOS, and Android players, creating a unified look and feel. </p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How can I add a WaterMark click-through URL?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> You can do this using the <samp class="ph codeph">controlBar.watermark.clickUrl</samp>
                field in <span class="ph filepath">skin.json</span>. </p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What will happen to syndicated players that are not on my website?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> They will remain operational unless they are migrated. </p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How can I add another Social share option?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> You must use advanced skin customization by altering the skin code
                directly. The associated code is located in the skin within
                <span class="ph filepath">js/views/shareScreen.js</span>. </p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What are the requirements for VAST tags for mobile?</strong></p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> As long as your tags are VAST-compliant, there are no mobile-specific
                    requirements, except a mobile-playable video format. VAST wrapper tags are also
                    supported.</p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What are the iOS limitations for Ad playback?</strong></p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> There is no clickthrough for ads on the iPhone. However, clickthrough
                    URLs are supported on iPad.</p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Would VPAID ads work in iOS?</strong></p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> VPAID (which is essentially Flash ads) does not work on iOS or
                    Android.</p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Can I assign ad sets dynamically at the page level?</strong></p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Yes, you can.</p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How should I setup VAST tags to work on mobile?</strong></p>

                <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> The easiest way is to use the Backlot UI to create an ad set of VAST
                    tags and associate that ad set with the videos. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> For use on mobile devices,
                        be sure to create the ad set as type "VAST Compliant" (either overlay or
                        in-stream). On mobile, when the video plays, its associated ads are played
                        as well. For more detail on creating ad sets in the Backlot UI, see <a class="xref" href="../tasks/monetization_ads_adsets_adnetworks_wrapper.html" title="This material includes how to create ad sets in Backlot and how to integrate with ad sources.">Working with Your Own Ad Assets, Ad Sets, and Ad Sources</a>. For information about setting up
                        dynamic ad tags with the Ooyala player on the desktop, see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/player_v3_dev_assignadset.html" title="The player enables you to assign ad sets dynamically.">Assigning Ad Sets Dynamically in Player V3 (Deprecated)</a>.</div>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> None, except LiveRail and TV2/Nord (TV2N).</p>

            </div>

            <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">High Performance API</h2>
                
                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Will POST and PATCH requests be faster when using the High Performance
                        API?</strong></p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> No. The high performance API endpoint at http://cdn-api.ooyala.com is
                    for speeding up response to GET (read) requests. It rejects other request
                    methods, such as POST or PATCH. For all non-GET requests, use the normal
                    endpoint at http://api.ooyala.com/. For more details, see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/api_high_performance.html" title="The high performance API endpoint caches repeated requests from large volume web sites.">High Performance API Endpoint</a>.</p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Do I get more credits when using the High Performance API?</strong></p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> You do not get more credits when you use the high performance API
                endpoint at http://cdn-api.ooyala.com. There is credit limit. The advantage of using
                High Performance API is that as long as you are requesting the same information
                (same API call) from the cache no credits are being used and so the credit limit is
                not affected. If the same call is used in a time window of 5 minutes no credits will
                be reduced from the account, as the results are cached for that period of time. But,
                if a call previously created is queried after 5 minutes from the first time the call
                was used, the new credits will be reduced from the account. For more details, see
                    <a class="xref" href="../concepts/api_rate_limiting.html" title="Through the Ooyala APIs, you are allowed 300 requests per minute. Each minute, the counter resets.">API Rate Limiting</a> and <a class="xref" href="../concepts/api_high_performance.html" title="The high performance API endpoint caches repeated requests from large volume web sites.">High Performance API Endpoint</a>.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> This is a known Apple issue. You must configure your Apple TV and remote to

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How do I set the player to fullscreen by default?</strong></p>

                <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> The easiest way to enter fullscreen in your app is to specify the
                        <samp class="ph codeph">controlType</samp> when you create the view controller. In the
                    snippet below (taken from the sample Getting Started app in the SDK
                    distribution), the <samp class="ph codeph">controlType</samp> of
                        <samp class="ph codeph">OOOoyalaPlayerControlTypeFullScreen</samp> has been added to the
                        <samp class="ph codeph">initWithPcode</samp> call:
                    <pre class="pre codeblock">// Create Ooyala ViewController

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How can I pass an Ad Set Code to the player dynamically?</strong></p>

                <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> You can pass the identifier (the name) of a defined ad set as an
                    argument to the <samp class="ph codeph">setEmbedCode</samp> function with the keyword
                        <samp class="ph codeph">adSetCode</samp>, as shown in the snippet below (taken from the
                    Getting Started sample app in the SDK distribution). In this example, the name
                    of the ad set has not yet been specified and is shown as a variable to be
                    replaced: <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;# NSString *)#&gt;</samp>.

                    For more details on the <samp class="ph codeph">setEmbedCode</samp> function, see the JavaDocs
                    in the SDK distribution.</div>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How do I use the bitrate selector?</strong></p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> There is no user interface for selecting bit rate, because we want to
                    allow the Adaptive Bit Rate (ABR) features of our system to work without any
                    human intervention. ABR efficiently selects the right stream on behalf of the
                    user. Programmatically, you can retrieve the current bit rate, but you cannot
                    set it. For our iOS Mobile SDK, see documentation for the
                        <samp class="ph codeph">bitrate</samp> function.</p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How can I show the CC option on the player?</strong></p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> You need to set up closed captions in the Backlot UI and associate them
                    with the video. You first need to create DFXP (now TTML) files for the desired languages and then
                associate those files with the videos. After this setup work, closed captions are
                displayed automatically on mobile devices whenever the viewer enters fullscreen mode
                and/or inline mode on iOS or fullscreen mode on Android. The viewer is also shown
                the controls to select a language.</p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Is it possible to allow viewers to watch video offline?</strong></p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> No.</p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Which are the ads supported in iOS SDKs?</strong></p>

                <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> We support the following ad formats, networks, and services: <ul class="ul">
                        <li class="li">VAST</li>

                        <li class="li">Google IMA</li>

</div>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Can I set videos to autoplay with the Mobile SDK for iOS?</strong></p>

                <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Yes, you can. The Mobile SDK will queue-up videos (embed codes) and
                    play them automatically once all system and app resources have been set up. All
                    you need is the following snippet:

                        pcode?</strong></p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Your pcode (also called "provider ID" or "Partner Code") is part of
                your API Key, which should always be viewable on the <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">ACCOUNTS</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol">Developers</span></span> tab. First, make sure you are logged into an account that should have
                a provider ID. The pcode is the alphanumeric string that precedes the period (".")
                in the API key. For example, if the API key is
                    <samp class="ph codeph">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.0000</samp>, then the pcode is the first
                28 characters (<samp class="ph codeph">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</samp>). For details, see
                    <a class="xref" href="../concepts/api_keys.html" title="Your Ooyala API credentials include your API key and secret, which you provide to sign HTTP requests and when using the scratchpad.">Your API Credentials</a>. If the

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What are the iOS limitations for ad playback?</strong></p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>There is no clickthrough behavior for ads on the iPhone. There are no skippable ads on the iPhone due to  this limitation. However, clickthrough URLs are supported on iPad devices.</p>

                <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> You can pass the identifier (the name) of a defined ad set as an
                    argument to the <samp class="ph codeph">setEmbedCodeWithAdSetCode()</samp> method. In this
                    example, the name of the ad set has not yet been specified and is shown as a
                    variable to be replaced: <samp class="ph codeph">nameOfAdSet&gt;</samp>.

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How do I use the bitrate selector?</strong></p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> There is no user interface for selecting bit rate, because we want to
                    allow the Adaptive Bit Rate (ABR) features of our system to work without any
                    human intervention. ABR efficiently selects the right stream on behalf of the
                    user. Programmatically, you can retrieve the current bit rate, but you cannot
                    set it. For our Android Mobile SDK, see the documentation for the
                        <samp class="ph codeph">getBitrate</samp> function.</p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How can I show the CC option on the player?</strong></p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> You need to set up closed captions in the Backlot UI and associate them
                    with the video. You first need to create DFXP (now TTML) files for the desired languages and then
                associate those files with the videos. After this setup work, closed captions are
                displayed automatically on mobile devices whenever the viewer enter fullscreen mode
                and / or inline mode on iOS or fullscreen mode on Android. The viewer is also shown
                the controls to select a language.</p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> At the very least you must use version 2.2.</p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Which are the ads supported in Android SDK?</strong></p>

                <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> We support the following ad formats, networks, and services: <ul class="ul">
                        <li class="li">VAST</li>

                        <li class="li">Google IMA</li>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Can I set videos to autoplay with the Mobile SDK for Android? </strong></p>

                <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Yes, you can. The Mobile SDK will queue-up videos (embed codes) and
                    play them automatically once all system and app resources have been set up. All
                    you need is the following code snippet:

player.setEmbedCode(embed);

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How do I know which player branding ID to use?</strong></p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The player branding ID (also sometimes simply called the "player ID")
                    for all your defined players is viewable in the Backlot UI. For your default
                    player's branding ID, go to the MANAGE page and select one of your videos. In
                    the lower portion of the screen, click the Embed tab. The player ID is displayed
                    at the lower right. If you have Ooyala Discovery enabled, go to the
                <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">PUBLISH</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol">Player Branding</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol">Discovery</span></span> page. The player ID is displayed towards the bottom of the page.</p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: The web page is not showing the right player. What do I need to check? </strong></p>

                <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>You need to verify that your web page is referring to the correct player ID (also called "player branding ID") in the code that embeds the player and video in your page.
                <ol class="ol">
                    <li class="li">First, find the player ID that is embedded in your page. For example, the following is an embed code; the player ID comes immediately after "v3/" and is highlighted in bold:
                    <pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;script src='//player.ooyala.com/v3/ <strong class="ph b">e18ab1da1813483499554ea2d8e67fbd'</strong>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;div id='ooyalaplayer' style='width:720px;height:480px'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script&gt;OO.ready(function() { OO.Player.create('ooyalaplayer', 'w3ZHc0Njr33Tdp-RRcwfZMjaOrmzOP82'); });&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div&gt;Please enable Javascript to watch this video&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;</pre>
</li>

                    <li class="li">Next, verify the player ID of the player that you are expecting to be displayed. (See the question "How do I know which branding ID to use?").</li>

                    <li class="li">Compare the two player IDs. Are they the same?</li>

                    <li class="li">In the embed code (the JavaScript &lt;script&gt; statement like the example shown above), substitute the correct player ID for the bad one.</li>

                    <li class="li">Retest your web page.</li>

                </ol>
</div>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How do I hide the AdCountDownMessage setting for Player V3?</strong></p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>In the Backlot UI, go to the PUBLISH page, "Player Branding" tab, "Player" subtab. In the left column is a checkbox for "Ad Countdown Message". Make sure this checkbox is not selected.

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How can I share my videos so they play within Facebook (not redirecting to my page)? </strong></p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The basic information about setting up sharing Ooyala-hosted videos on
                    Facebook, including the Ooyala Facebook Sample Code/SDK, is described in <a class="xref" href="../concepts/chapter_facebook.html" title="There are several ways you can post Ooyala-based videos to Facebook timelines.">Sharing Video on Facebook</a>. On the Facebook’s
                    timeline or other post on Facebook, the playback on Facebook will always occur.
                    However, there are two different behaviors with the thumbnail image and the text
                    information from the URL (title and description): if the user clicks on the
                    image, the video always plays, but next to the image there is a text square. If
                    the user clicks the title or the description the browser is redirected to
                    another window. Facebook has an internal cache that might cause a delay in
                    showing the expected results. If you are testing your developed programs and are
                    updating them frequently, it is necessary to rename the URL for them to override
                    Facebook’s cache so you get the latest behavior.</p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: I'm getting a Content Unavailable error when playing back in Facebook. What should I do?</strong></p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>There can be a wide variety of reasons for this error, everything from network problems to possible service outages. Attempt to access the video several times, and If the problem persists, file a ticket with Brightcove Technical Support.</p>

                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Does Facebook have syndication or monetization restrictions? What are they?</strong></p>

                <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The follow types of publishing rules can limit access to  videos posted to Facebook:
