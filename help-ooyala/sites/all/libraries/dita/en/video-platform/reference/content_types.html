 <h1 class="title topictitle1">Supported Content Types</h1>

 
 <div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">Ooyala supports these popular content types.</p>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Video</h2>When you upload a video to Backlot, Backlot automatically transcodes
      it using the settings specified for your account and makes the videos available for playback
      through your player. <p class="p">We recommend that you upload videos to Backlot in H.264. We also
        support many commonly used codecs (see <a class="xref" href="input_formats.html" title="Before uploading content to Backlot, make sure you are using a supported file format and following the best practices for source files.">Supported Ingest Formats</a> for details). </p>
</div>


   <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Audio</h2>
      To play an audio asset on an Ooyala player you can upload the audio asset
      and have it transcoded as a video with a blank slate. This asset can be played on our Player
      as a video asset. The playback stack will choose the appropriate stream. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> We recommend
        that you upload audio in the AAC format. We also support other formats (see <a class="xref" href="input_formats.html" title="Before uploading content to Backlot, make sure you are using a supported file format and following the best practices for source files.">Supported Ingest Formats</a> for details).</div>
</div>


  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Remote Asset</h2>
   
   <p class="p">A remote asset is a piece of content that you add to Backlot
    without uploading, processing, or storing the content with Ooyala.
    Remote asset management provides all of the benefits of Backlot,
    including management, syndication, monetization, analytics, and access to the Ooyala APIs.</p>

   <p class="p">Ooyala supports the following formats:</p>

   <ul class="ul">
    <li class="li">mp4, m4a, mov, 3gp, 3g2, flv, f4v</li>

    <li class="li">SMIL via HTTP (single stream), SMIL via RTMP (multiple streams)</li>

   </ul>

   <p class="p">Remote assets can be added to Backlot using the Backlot UI or through the APIs. After a piece of content is added
        to Backlot, Ooyala stores basic
        information about it, including the duration and title. Rules, customizations, preview
        images, and additional metadata can be applied to remote assets through the Backlot UI or APIs </p>

   <p class="p">Once uploaded, remote assets can be delivered by Ooyala or a CDN
    of your choice. </p>

  </div>

   
   <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">YouTube Video</h2>
      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Due to rapid and unpredictable changes in YouTube requirements,
        playback for YouTube assets is supported only with older Ooyala players (Player v4.10.6 and
        earlier, and Player V3). Playback of YouTube assets uploaded to Backlot will not work with
        recent releases of Ooyala Player V4. Ooyala continues to support uploading of YouTube assets
        for content management purposes.</div>
 A YouTube video is a video
      hosted by YouTube and played through the Ooyala player. This enables you to: <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">Maintain a consistent look and feel across your site with the Ooyala player or your
          custom player. </li>

        <li class="li">Leverage the use of Ooyala's rich APIs for an integrated and customized experience.</li>

        <li class="li">Gain insight and maintain the benefits of Ooyala's leading analytics for all videos in
          your account. </li>

        <li class="li">Discover supplemental content for your site from Youtube, the Internet's largest video
          library.</li>

        <li class="li">Apply time, geographic, or domain-based rules to the content.</li>

        <li class="li">Leverage Ooyala's intuitive and comprehensive tools to manage, syndicate, customize, and
          analyze YouTube content, along with your own content.</li>

      </ul>
<p class="p">YouTube videos are sourced from YouTube, are not downloaded to your account, are not
        transcoded by Ooyala, and are not applied to your delivery or managed content allowances. As
        a result, all videos will contain a YouTube watermark and will be delivered using the best
        quality YouTube can provide based on the embed size of the player. </p>
<p class="p">Keep in mind that
        YouTube content might not always be available to the player. For example, videos might be
        removed, videos might be restricted based on YouTube publisher rules, or access to YouTube
        might be blocked by a viewerâ€™s company or institution.</p>
</div>


  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Ad</h2>
       Ooyala currently supports two types of ads: linear (in-stream) and
      non-linear (overlay). <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">A linear ad is simply a video that is marked as an ad. Once marked, you can add video
          ads to the beginning of videos (pre-roll), during videos (mid-roll), or to the end of
          videos (post-roll). Video ads can be individually added to videos, or you can group them
          in ad sets, which automatically rotates them. </li>

        <li class="li">Non-linear ads are text ads that display while videos are playing. You can associate
          third-party ad networks (e.g., DoubleClick) with your videos. As your videos play,
          advertisements from the third party ad network automatically appear. When an advertisement
          appears, viewers can click it to follow the offer.</li>

      </ul>
<p class="p">To use non-linear ads, you need an ad tag and, optionally, a tracking pixel URL. An ad
        tag is a URL that provides information about your organization and the types of ads to serve
        to the third-party ad network. A tracking pixel URL enables the ad network to monitor the
        delivery of their ads. </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  If you want third-party ad networks to run advertisements
        during your videos, contact Sales, your Customer Success Manager, or Technical Support.
