    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Using Discovery</h2>
      
      <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">Q: What is Discovery?</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The Ooyala Discovery recommendation engine uses industry standard big data and
        recommendations technologies, including Hadoop and MapReduce, and collaborative filtering,
        to generate related and trending content recommendations for consumers. Recommendations
        are highly configurable. You can use labels and filters to customize the recommendations
        provided. You can configure the player to provided recommendations when the consumer is done
        viewing a selected asset and/or when the Player is paused.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
     
      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How does Discovery work?</strong></p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Discovery provides recommendations to viewers. The site administrator, and anyone
        added to the distribution list, receives a weekly Insight report showing what
        recommendations are displayed and which recommended assets are viewed.</p>

      
      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How is Discovery enabled and managed?</strong></p>

      <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">A: </strong> Contact your sales representative to activate Discovery features for your site. </p>

      <p class="p">When Discovery is enabled, the recommendation options can be configured for a specific
        Ooyala player using Backlot (The Discovery options are available form the
          <span class="ph uicontrol">Publish</span> tab). If your site uses multiple Ooyala players, Discovery
        must be enabled separately for each. Discovery profile settings are named uniquely for the
        linked player.</p>

      <p class="p">Although an Ooyala player is required to create a Discovery profile, the player and the
        Backlot interface are not required to power recommendations on your site. Once Discovery is
        enabled via Backlot, Discovery settings can be managed from the Backlot Discovery interface
        and the Discovery API. If using only the Ooyala player Discovery interface to deliver
        recommendations to consumers, the deployment can be managed completely using Backlot.
        However, the Discovery APIs are a powerful option for managing site recommendations with
        options for configuring the player display. For more information see:</p>

      </ul>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: My site uses a different URL for each video asset. Can Discovery support
        this?</strong></p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Absolutely! Discovery can be configured to open recommended videos in the same
        player, the same page, or new page. A recommended video will open in a new page as long as
        permalink URL is available in the metadata for that asset.</p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Does Discovery work on mobile platforms?</strong></p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Yes.</p>

      <p class="p">For information regarding Discovery on mobile platforms, see
          <a class="xref" href="../concepts/android_aboutdiscovery.html">About Discovery for Android Native Apps</a> and <a class="xref" href="../concepts/ios_aboutdiscovery.html">About Discovery for iOS Native Apps</a>.</p>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Recommendations</h2>
      
      <p class="p" id="discovery_faq__editoralcontrol"><strong class="ph b">Q: Does Discovery allow editor control over the recommendations?</strong></p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Editors can influence Discovery recommendations in several ways:</p>

      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">Use labels to include or exclude specific content based on the applied label.</li>

        <li class="li">Select spots in the Discovery tray (1st recommended video, 2nd recommended video, etc.)
          to be filled by the freshest content (asset) that may contain a specific label. This
          allows editors to promote certain content in a targeted manner.</li>

        <li class="li"> Override Discovery recommendations by selecting assets with shared labels. For more
          information about these options see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/chapter_labels.html" title="When added to external publishing targets, labels specify which videos, channels, and channel sets to publish externally.">Labels</a>. </li>

      </ul>

      
      <p class="p" id="discovery_faq__engagement"><strong class="ph b">Q: How can I confirm that Discovery recommendations are increasing
          engagement on my site?</strong></p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The Discovery Insights Report is generated weekly. This report provides metrics
        on engagement categories that help determine Discovery’s impact of discovery recommendations
        on consumer engagement. For more information about the Insight report, see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/cd_discovery_insights_report.html" title="Ooyala Discovery Insights reports provide a detailed view of key performance indicators (KPIs) for user engagement and growth.">Discovery Insights Reports (No Longer Available)</a>.</p>

      <p class="p">If you want to test metrics independent of the insight report use two Ooyala players, one
        with Discovery enabled and one without Discovery on your site for A/B testing. A/B testing
        is also useful when using Discovery APIs to deliver recommendations outside the Ooyala
        player on your site.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What can I expect in terms of a lift in streams and engagement?</strong></p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Metrics around engagement based on Discovery recommendations are dependent upon
        the volume of traffic for your site. </p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: I have a proprietary recommendations engine today. How can I try Discovery out and
        measure growth over the current engine?</strong></p>

      <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Trial versions of Discovery are available. With a trial version of the
        recommendations engine you can review the metrics available from the Insights report, and
        perform A/B testing. For more information about starting a Discovery trial, contact your
        sales representative.</p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How can I disable autoplay of the next video from the Discovery tray?</strong></p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Autoplay cannot be disabled entirely. However you can use the Discovery API to
        set the <samp class="ph codeph">default_countdown</samp> parameter to a high number. This number specified
        the number of seconds after which the next video will autoplay. The default is 10. The
        Backlot Discovery interface limits this setting to 99 seconds or less. For details about
        using the API to set this limit higher than 99 seconds using the
          <samp class="ph codeph">default_countdown</samp> parameter, see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/content_discovery_profile_api.html" title="Learn about using Discovery API requests to manage discovery profiles.">Managing Discovery Profiles with the Discovery API</a>. </p>

      
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What data is available to track engagement from Discovery?</strong></p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The Discovery Insights Report is generated weekly. This report provides metrics
        on engagement categories that help determine Discovery’s impact on consumer engagement, in
        relation to organic consumption. For more information about the Insight report, see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/cd_discovery_insights_report.html" title="Ooyala Discovery Insights reports provide a detailed view of key performance indicators (KPIs) for user engagement and growth.">Discovery Insights Reports (No Longer Available)</a>.</p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Why do I see the same asset recommended as in the previous batch?</strong></p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Discovery is a stateless recommendation engine. Session specific consumer
        behavior data is not stored. In any given session the consumer’s historical usage data is
        leveraged, which may result in the same video asset being recommended again over subsequent
        recommended lists. The Discovery UX in the Ooyala player filters out any videos that may
        have been in the previous batch of recommendations. Ooyala recommends that publisher sites
        use a similar front-end/client side filter when using the Discovery APIs.</p>

      </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Analytics</h2>
      
      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What is the Discovery Feedback Loop?</strong></p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Discovery recommendations are based on machine learning algorithms that track
        consumer behavior. The Feedback Loop is a critical piece of this infrastructure that
        registers impressions and clicks for recommended content and processes the data to refine
        the preferences for each consumer in real-time. For more information see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/content_discovery_about_feedback_loop.html" title="Improve recommendations for your customers by feeding behavior activity from the user to Ooyala Discovery.">Discovery Feedback Loop</a>.</p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How does Discovery relate different impression and click data passed through the
          Feedback Loop API for each consumer?</strong></p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The <samp class="ph codeph">device ID</samp> is a required identifier for recording consumer
        impressions and click data. Consolidation of data points is based on device IDs. In
        addition, the Ooyala player <samp class="ph codeph">bucket info</samp> may also be sent via the Feedback
        Loop, enabling Discovery to gather additional data about the impression or click event. For
        more information see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/content_discovery_about_feedback_loop.html" title="Improve recommendations for your customers by feeding behavior activity from the user to Ooyala Discovery.">Discovery Feedback Loop</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Can I influence the algorithms that Discovery uses?</strong></p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Discovery uses machine learning algorithms that learn continually based on
        consumer behavior. In a cold start scenario, when no usage data is available for a consumer,
        content related to the current asset is recommended. When no current asset is available,
        Trending data is recommended.</p>

      <p class="p"> Discovery provides several options to help you influence asset recommendations: </p>

      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">Use labels to include or exclude specific content based on the labels. For more
          information see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/chapter_labels.html" title="When added to external publishing targets, labels specify which videos, channels, and channel sets to publish externally.">Labels</a>. </li>

        <li class="li">Use the Backlot Discovery interface to configure asset profiles. For more information
          see <a class="xref" href="../tasks/content_turnondiscovery_backlotui.html" title="You can use the Backlot UI to create discovery profiles to use with defined players or on Discovery API requests.">Creating Discovery Profiles Using the Backlot UI</a>. </li>

        <li class="li">Use the Discovery API to configure editorial parameters for filtering content. For more
          information see <a class="xref" href="../api/content_discovery_common_queryparms.html" title="These query string parameters can be used on API requests for similar/related assets, trending, and personalized recommendations.">Query String Parameters</a>.</li>

      </ul>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">APIs</h2>
      
      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Does Discovery provide any client-side (JavaScript) APIs?</strong></p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The Discovery API is RESTful. Depending on your use case, implementation, and
        environment,  it is possible to use the <samp class="ph codeph">XMLHttpRequest</samp> object to leverage
        the Discovery API. For more information see <a class="xref" href="../api/content_discovery.html">Ooyala Discovery API Reference</a> and reference
        information specific to your Javascript or Ajax implementation.</p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Editorial query string parameters and Discovery Profiles appear to do the same thing.
          Are they any different?</strong></p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Discovery API requests return a base set of recommendations from the
        machine-learning algorithm. This base set can be modified using Discovery profiles (see
          <a class="xref" href="../concepts/content_discovery_profile.html" title="You can create reusable discovery profiles that configure Ooyala Discovery settings for content recommendations that appear in a player.">Discovery Profiles</a>), or by
        leveraging editorial query string parameters (see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/cd_api_editorial.html" title="To enable you to adjust the results of the Ooyala Discovery recommendations, Ooyala provides query string parameters on the baseline APIs.">Discovery Editorial Query String Parameters</a>). Both options can be used to
        customize the base set of recommendations, however Ooyala recommends using Discovery
        profiles rather than editorial query string parameters.</p>

      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: I used filters when calling the Discovery APIs and do not get any assets returned.
          Why?</strong></p>

      <p class="p"> A call that mixes the <samp class="ph codeph">filter_by</samp> and the
          <samp class="ph codeph">discovery_profile_id</samp> could cause this issue. The
          <samp class="ph codeph">filter_by</samp> parameter always take precedence over
          <samp class="ph codeph">discovery_profile_id</samp>, effectively nullifying the profile. For more
        information see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/content_discovery_design_approaches.html" title="Consider these design issues when implementing discovery for your player.">Discovery Design Considerations</a>.</p>
