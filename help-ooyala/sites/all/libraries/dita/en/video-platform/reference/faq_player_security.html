            <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Ooyala Player V3 is deprecated and is scheduled
    to be <em class="ph i">disabled</em> on 2018-01-31. After that date, Player V3 will no longer play your video
    or audio content. Customers still using Player V3 need to migrate to Player V4 (see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/pbv4_migration_v3.html">Migrating from Player V3</a> and <a class="xref" href="../concepts/pbv4_migration_faq.html">Player Migration FAQ</a>).</div>

            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What version does Ooyala support?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Widevine Modular is a 3rd party content protection mechanism that Ooyala supports
                as part of its overall content protection offering. Widevine Modular supports playback on
                Mobile with our SDKs. Customers might also use a Widevine Modular-based app on connected TV
                devices.</p>

            <p class="p">Widevine version releases are updated on a regular basis and are tested by Ooyala to
                ensure compatibility. As you prepare your implementation, please check with us
                directly to validate that there are no compatibility issues with the Widevine
                version that you are interested in using.</p>

            <div class="p">For more information about using Widevine with the Ooyala video platform, see the
                following documentation: <ul class="ul">

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Why are my videos not playing in Safari or another browser?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>One of the first items to check is the browser and browser version. You can
                check what browser versions we support in our <a class="xref" href="player_requirements.html" title="Player V3 is designed to deliver the highest quality experience for live and on demand video.">Player
                    Requirements</a> documentation.</p>

            <div class="p">Basically, the video bytes are not getting to the client. Some items that might
                impact the video playback in Safari and other browsers are: <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">Authorization issues (most common): <ul class="ul">
                            <li class="li">You may not have the correct encoding to play on your device of
                                choice. Encoding refers to each transcoded file (specified by video
                                bit rate, content width, audio bit rate, and delivery method).</li>

                            <li class="li">If you are using content protection you may have compatibility
                                issues with your browsers and devices. For example Widevine Modular only
                                works with our SDKs and connected TVs.</li>

                        </ul>

                    </li>

                    <li class="li">Browser issues: <ul class="ul">
                            <li class="li">Video errors and/or failures can occur when using a Flash player on
                                a browser where third-party cookies are disabled. Given that Safari
                                blocks Flash Access cookies, if you are using a Flash player, your
                                viewers can have issues with video playback. You may need to
                                stipulate the use of a non-Safari browser when using a Flash player
                                and Adobe Access.</li>

                            <li class="li">Safari’s blocking of cookies can also have an impact on VAST ad
                                management integration with our player. This may impede playback.
                                You should test playback on other browsers.</li>

                        </ul>

                    </li>

                    <li class="li">Profile Setting issues: <ul class="ul">
                            <li class="li">You may have issues with bitrate settings, transcoding, or other
                                overhead. In these cases you many need to contact Ooyala Technical

</li>

                </ul>
In all cases, try testing the video by creating a web page with just the video
                embed and no apps or other code on Safari and other browsers. If you cannot resolve
                the issue, you need to open a help ticket and supply your system information and
                your logs. You can also use the <a class="xref" href="../concepts/player_v3_dev_debugtool.html" title="Use our Chrome extension to help Ooyala debug video problems you might encounter.">Ooyala Chrome Extension for Debugging/Troubleshooting</a> to

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Which policies are supported at this time?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Ooyala gives you the ability to choose from multiple pre-defined policies.
                These policies are determined at license issuance time so that a piece of content
                can be packaged once but authorized for different policies (e.g., renting a movie
                vs. purchasing a movie). Since these policies may vary over time, you should check
                with your Customer Success Manager (CSM) or Technical Support contact for the
                supported policies. </p>

            <div class="p">You can also review our documentation about various content protection policies: <ul class="ul">

                        use this information as a starting point and ask your Customer Success
                        Manager for the specific policies that we support.</li>

                    <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="../concepts/chapter_configurable_drm.html" title="Digital Rights Management (DRM) enables you to control how viewers consume and access your high value content through DRM policies.

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What versions is Ooyala using and/or supporting?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Adobe Pass is a third party content protection mechanism that Ooyala
                supports as part of its overall content protection offering. Adobe Pass versions are
                updated on a regular basis and are tested by Ooyala to ensure compatibility. Contact
                your Ooyala Customer Success Manager to validate that there are no compatibility
                issues with the Adobe Pass version that you are interested in using.</p>

            <p class="p">For documentation about the process and requirements for implementing Adobe Pass, you
                can start with <a class="xref" href="../concepts/contentprotection_optionsbydevice.html" title="Technology options vary by type of target device, network, streaming protocol, and other factors.">Content Protection Options by Device</a> and then look at <a class="xref" href="../concepts/adobepass_integration.html">Integrating Adobe

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Player Token</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: When is the Ooyala Player Token recommended?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The Ooyala Player Token (OPT) is in the category of user authorization
                tokens that ensures that encrypted content cannot be downloaded until the client has
                been verified and prevents content from being played in a non-Ooyala player.</p>

            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Available only if your Ooyala account includes this functionality. 
                To enable Ooyala Player Token, contact your account manager.</div>

            <p class="p">This type of content protection is recommended in situations where there is the risk
                that authorized users can take the embedded player JavaScript (.js) script tag
                generated in Backlot and distribute it freely to others for replay, or engage in
                other similar replay attacks. The Ooyala Player Token authorization feature lets you
                (content publishers and providers) secure your content from these types of risks.
                You can use this authorization to protect your monetized content from unauthorized
                distribution. </p>

            <p class="p">The Ooyala Player Token requires client cookies, and they may have an impact on your
                decision to use it. If you cannot use cookies or have frequent situations where the
                cookies are blocked, you may need to select another content protection option.
                Ooyala also has a separate level of token security offered through CDN tokens. CDN
                tokens operate slightly differently than the Ooyala Player Token. The Ooyala Player
                Token secures playback within the actual Ooyala player while CDNs offer token
                protection over individual assets. Some CDNs offer token authentication to protect
                the stream itself, however we currently do not offer this feature.</p>

            <p class="p">We support the Akamai CDN. We only support the CDN token authentication, not
                combinations of CDN asset and stream-based content protection. For example, you can
                have Akamai TBA for an asset but not a combination of Akamai TBA and Akamai TBA for
                mp4 stream.</p>

            <p class="p"/>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Will the Ooyala Player Token prevent others from stealing my content?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The Ooyala Player Token can prevent the unauthorized access and
                distribution of your content but it does not cover all possible security breaches.
                Ooyala has a number of other content protection features that you can use to apply
                layers of security to your content. For an overview of the levels and layers of
                security that you can apply to your content, see the article, “Survey of <a class="xref" href="../concepts/contentprotection_types_and_technologies.html" title="The types of content protection available today can be categorized into three groups.">Content Protection Technology</a>" in our Support Center documentation.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: I'm getting the error "Invalid Token". Now what?</strong></p>

            <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The error “Invalid Token” can have a number of root causes. Some of the
                cases include: <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">Incompatibility with other features or security mechanisms. For example, if
                        you use Ooyala Player Token (OPT) with an audio player, Adobe Pass is not
                        compatible with the audio player and this may result in an Invalid Token
                        error.</li>

                    <li class="li">If you use OPT with Widevine, or other security mechanisms, you need to make
                        sure you send the token with the license request.</li>

                    <li class="li">By default, some browsers, such as Apple Safari, disallow third-party
                        cookies, which can interfere with your OPT or authorization requests. </li>

                </ul>
 You need to check all points of failure. You should also review the <a class="xref" href="../concepts/player_v3dev_authoverview.html">Ooyala Player
                    Token</a> documentation and the <a class="xref" href="../concepts/contentprotection_optionsbydevice.html" title="Technology options vary by type of target device, network, streaming protocol, and other factors.">Content
                    Protection Options By Device</a> information. If you cannot resolve the
                issue, you need to open a help ticket and supply your system information and your
                logs. You can also use the <a class="xref" href="../concepts/player_v3_dev_debugtool.html" title="Use our Chrome extension to help Ooyala debug video problems you might encounter.">Ooyala Chrome Extension for Debugging/Troubleshooting</a> to
                help you work with support.</div>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What happens if a user's cookies are disabled. Will this affect the license
                    request process?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Yes, because cookies are involved in the authorization check process. If
                the Ooyala Player Token(OPT) is enabled for an asset, the license request must
                contain the <var class="keyword varname">auth_token</var> returned in the authorization server (SAS)
                response. This is because the license request also includes an authorization check
                and token. With OPT, the embedded player loading event triggers the communication of
                the token request URL to the player. The player then requests authorization and a
                token from the Ooyala authorization server (SAS), using the token request. Depending
                on whether the request made justifies playback, the authorization server returns
                either a valid cookie and authorized response or an invalid cookie and an
                unauthorized response is returned. We can see, in this case, if cookies are disabled
                on the end-user's browser, the auth check will fail and the license request will
                return a 'User is not authorized' error.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Adobe Access is a 3rd party content protection mechanism that Ooyala
                supports as part of its overall content protection offering. Adobe Access versions
                are updated on a regular basis and are tested by Ooyala to ensure compatibility.
                Contact your Brightcove Technical Support to validate that there are no compatibility
                issues with the Adobe Access version that you are interested in using.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: My viewers are having trouble viewing my videos in Safari. What is going
                    on?</strong></p>

            <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Basically, the video bytes are not getting to the client. Some items that
                might impact the video playback in Safari are: <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">Video errors and/or failures can occur when using a Flash player and
                        third-party cookies are disabled in the browser. Given that Safari blocks
                        Flash Access cookies, if you are using a Flash player, your viewers can have
                        issues with video playback.</li>

                    <li class="li">If the videos are playing on more than one machine, you can ask the viewers
                        to clear their token with the following instructions: <a class="xref" href="http://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/multi/removing-flash-access-data-files.html" target="_blank">http://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/multi/removing-flash-access-data-files.html</a>.
                        As Safari blocks third-party cookies, you might consider moving away from
                        using cookies for token authorization. You can use the Play Ready auth_token
                        as a query string parameter. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/player_v3dev_playreadyexample.html" title="A PlayReady reference implementation shows example code needed to implement and initialize PlayReady content protection.">Play

                    <li class="li">The stream may require an embed/player token.</li>

                    <li class="li">Issues with ad manager integration. In some cases issues with Safari have
                        been noted with the VAST ad manager.</li>

                    <li class="li">You can also check the version of Safari that your viewers using. Make sure
                        it is a supported version. See our <a class="xref" href="player_requirements.html" title="Player V3 is designed to deliver the highest quality experience for live and on demand video.">Player

                    <li class="li">You can try to isolate the issue by testing the video without Adobe Access
                        enabled to determine if it an issue with the browser or with the Flash

If you cannot resolve the issue, you need to open a help ticket and supply your

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Which DRM policies are supported at this time?</strong>
            </p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong> In general, Ooyala gives you the ability to choose from multiple
                pre-defined DRM policies. These policies are determined at license issuance time and
                can include policies issued on a package or more commonly issued as policies
                enforced on output controls (such as enforcing no playback if HDCP is not present). </p>

            <div class="p">For more details, see our documentation on DRM policies: <ul class="ul">

                content protection from a third party, check the documentation for information about
                supported policies. Since these types of content protection policies may vary over
                time, to find out the specific policies we support at this time, check with your
                Customer Success Manager (CSM).<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> An Ooyala Support Engineer must set up your
                    policies before you can assign them to assets.</div>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: If a piece of content is packaged once and authorized for different policies,
                    how does the player know when to enforce one policy or the other?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The license server applies a policy to the asset during runtime. The
                license server can override any policy attribute specified during packaging. Thus,
                policies are determined by the license server; the player gets a single policy
                applied to the asset.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Is Flash Access supported on Android?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Flash Access (now called Adobe Access) is supported on Android Air and
                Android Native implementations. However, you need to be aware of all the various
                types of support for the different content protection mechanisms and how they
                interact. You can start by reviewing the article <a class="xref" href="../concepts/contentprotection_optionsbydevice.html" title="Technology options vary by type of target device, network, streaming protocol, and other factors.">Content
                    Protection by Device</a> in our Customer Support documentation. You should
                also check with the manufacture as support may change. For example, more recent
                versions of the Android OS may not support Flash at all. </p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: I'm getting the error "License Server Unavailable". What now?</strong></p>

            <div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>A “License Server Unavailable” error indicates that a response from the
                Ooyala authorization server is not occurring. As this server is responsible for
                responding to authentication and token requests, the error can indicate: <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">Authentication problems. The viewer may not have created a login or password

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Concurrent Streams</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How often will the player send a heartbeat to establish that a user is watching
                    a video and concurrent streaming limits can be enforced?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The player sends a heartbeat every 5 minutes. For example: If a viewer
                stops watching a video 2 minutes after the last heartbeat, the viewer will not be
                able to watch another video for another 3 minutes. </p>

            <p class="p">Publishers who want to avoid imposing the waiting period between switching videos,
                can pass the <var class="keyword varname">auth_token</var> along in the authorization request for
                the next video so that the same <var class="keyword varname">auth_id</var> (this is used to
                determine a unique stream) can be used for the next video.</p>

            <p class="p">The <var class="keyword varname">auth_tokens</var> do expire, but the <var class="keyword varname">auth_id</var> can
                still be extracted from an expired <var class="keyword varname">auth_token</var> (there is a
                separate expiry time for the <var class="keyword varname">auth_id</var>). The
                    <var class="keyword varname">auth_id</var> expiration time is 10 minutes and is renewed on each
                authorization and heartbeat request. The values inside the
                    <var class="keyword varname">auth_token</var> are encrypted so the <var class="keyword varname">auth_id</var> is
                not visible in plain text. Generally each authorization request will generate a new
                    <var class="keyword varname">auth_id</var>. However, if you pass an
                    <var class="keyword varname">auth_token</var> generated from a previous request as a query
                parameter in a new authorization request, our code will try to reuse the
                    <var class="keyword varname">auth_id</var> in the old <var class="keyword varname">auth_token</var> (as long as
                it's not expired) and generate a new <var class="keyword varname">auth_token</var> with the same
                    <var class="keyword varname">auth_id</var>.This allows you to switch between videos quickly
                without getting blocked for reaching the concurrent stream limit.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The player will throw a generic license server error. It is up to the
                publisher to determine what was the exact cause of the error. If device limits are
                being used, the publisher should call the <var class="keyword varname">last_result</var> API after
                the DRM request. The <var class="keyword varname">last_result</var> API will tell you what was the
                result of device registration (registration happens during DRM request). Here's more
                info about the <var class="keyword varname">last_result</var> API:<a class="xref" href="../api/device_registration_customersupportportals.html">Device Registration API for Customer Support Portals</a>.</p>

            <p class="p">Device limits are account wide. For example, if you have an account with a device
                limit of 3 and the PPV limit is only 1, only the first device that attempts playback
                will be allowed to watch the PPV. (Note that this device counts as one of the
