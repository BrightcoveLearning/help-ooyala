            <div class="section">
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What is changing?</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> As part of ongoing efforts to maintain and increase the performance of Ooyala IQ,
                                Ooyala is implementing a new data retention policy effective April
                                1, 2018.</p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What is the new data retention policy, and how does it affect me?</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> As of April 1, 2018, Ooyala IQ will keep at least 27 months of data relative to the current date.</p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q:
                            Can I still access older data before you make the change</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Yes. However, on April 1, 2018, we will remove any data that precedes January 1, 2016. If you need access to that data after the changes come into effect, you need to download the data and store it locally before April 1, 2018.</p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: I do not care about data more than 27 months old. What do I need to
                                        do?</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> If you do not care about data that is more than 27 months old, you do not need to do
                                anything.</p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What is the best way to extract old data before it passes the 27-month
                                        mark?</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> The best way to extract old data before it is purged is by using the Ooyala IQ API. For
                                more information, see <a class="xref" href="../api/analytics_v3_api_reporting_post_example.html">How Can I Make a Long and Detailed Query?</a>.</p>

                    <p class="p">Before you begin, you will need to identify the following:</p>

                    <ul class="ul"><li class="li">The combinations of dimensions that cover your use cases. For example, device type + operating system or asset + device_type.</li>

                            <li class="li">The metrics you need. For a list of available metrics, see <a class="xref" href="../api/analytics_v3_api_reporting_metrics.html">Metrics</a>.</li>

                            <li class="li">The time granularity of each data point (daily, weekly,
                                        monthly).</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p class="p">Then use the following rules of thumb to determine the time range to include in each request:</p>

                    <ul class="ul"><li class="li">For requests including asset dimension, include no more than 1 week of data. If your library
                                        sees activity in  more than 2000 different videos per day,
                                        consider including no more than 1 day of data.</li>

                            <li class="li">For daily granularity, include no more than 1 month of data (without
                                        asset dimension).</li>

                            <li class="li">Do not use filters. This will significantly increase the number of
                                        requests you will need. Instead, extract unfiltered data,
                                        then apply filters in your copy of the data.</li>

                    </ul>
