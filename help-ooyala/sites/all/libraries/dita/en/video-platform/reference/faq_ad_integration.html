            <div class="p">The following ad providers are supported by Ooyala but are not actively being

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What ad positions are supported on the Ooyala player V3?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> For matrices of what ad integrations and ad positions are supported for
                each platform, please see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/ads_integration_overview.html">Client Side Ad Integration</a>.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Where can I find documentation on how to integrate the Ooyala player with
                    different ad management platforms?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> See <a class="xref" href="../concepts/book_ads_integration.html" title="This documentation describes how to set up integrations for ad servers, ad networks, and ad management platforms for Player V3.">Player V3 Ad Integration</a>.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How do ads work on Hook? Is this done through VAST tags?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Yes, only VAST ads are supported with Hook.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Why is an ad on my mobile device showing a "Learn More" button? Can I disable it?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>This comes from your ad network. If the ad response includes a click
                through URL, the button will be shown. Currently there is no way to disable or
                customize the Learn More button, but we plan on updating this functionality in the
                future.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Google IMA FAQ</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What ad rule positions does Ooyala support for Google IMA ads?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> For matrices of what ad rule ad positions are supported on Ooyala Flash
                players, HTML5 players, and Mobile SDKs, please see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/ads_dev_chapter_googleima.html">Player V3 Google IMA Ad Integration</a>.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: In Backlot, the user has the option to add several ad types and ads in one
                    adset. For example, a VAST pre-roll, a VPAID overlay, and a Googe IMA post-roll
                    can be combined into one adset. Can this be done with player parameters?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> With VAST, you can use the vastAds Parameter to set up multiple VAST ads of
                different types. Like pre-rolls, post-rolls etc., just like if you were in Backlot.
                In Google IMA, you can't use parameters; you can only change the ad tag that is
                used. If you have an ad rule set in Backlot, then at page level you can change the
                ad rule. If it isn't an ad rule ad, then you can change the video but you can't
                setup ads to play.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">LiveRail FAQ</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What current ad types does Ooyala support for LiveRail Ads?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong> See <a class="xref" href="../concepts/ads_dev_chapter_liverail.html">Integrating LiveRail Ads with Player V3</a>.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What platforms support LiveRail on the Ooyala player?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Ooyala supports LiveRail on the Flash platform via an OPF plugin.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How would I go about getting the LiveRail plugin configured on my Ooyala player?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Log into the <span class="ph">Ooyala <a class="xref" href="../../../../../../../contact.html" target="_blank">Customer Portal</a></span> and submit a
                ticket requesting that this ad source be added to your account. Once it's enabled
                you'll be able to create ad sets for LiveRail.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">FreeWheel FAQ</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Does the Ooyala player support FreeWheel ads with JavaScript surveys?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> The surveys need to be embedded in the ad itself. We do not parse ad
                responses to implemented surveys in the Player UI. So, unless the survey is a
                clickthrough in ad or within the ad itself, it won't be supported.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section" id="faq_ad_integration__vast_faq"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">VAST FAQ</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How does Ooyala Pulse track VAST ad impressions for podded ad sets (e.g.
                mid-roll ads)?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Ooyala's support for VAST on the iOS and Android Mobile SDKs for Player v3 has recently changed the way ad impressions are tracked in Ooyala Pulse. For podded ad sets like mid-roll ads, impressions are tracked when each individual ad in a podded ad set has started to play. This gives you a more accurate view of ad impressions tracked for sessions played through the Ooyala Player via iOS and Android applications. </p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What if the ad server doesn't return a response? Does Ooyala support passback?
                    If there is timeout, what is the timeout value (sec)?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> We do not support passback at this time. We offer a timeout across HTML5
                and Flash: 5-10 seconds for HTML5 and 18 seconds for Flash.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Is there any limitation on ad video duration? If yes, how long is the
                    maximum?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> No, the ad duration doesnâ€™t have a time limit. However, we do have a 30
                second limit on overlay ads for Flash.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How many VAST wrapper redirects can we follow?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> We currently support the IAB standard of 4 redirects.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Does an adset need to be created for VAST to work, if the tags are created
                    programatically? My understanding was that an ad set HAD to be created. Also,
                    how to you get more than one pre-roll to show? My assumption was that you change
                    the frequency parameter.</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> No, you don't need to set up the VAST ads in Backlot to add them to the
                player; you can use the vastAds parameter instead.  If you use the VAST page level
                parameter instead, then it only changes the video; whereas vastAds overrides and
                creates VAST ads to be added to a video with or without Backlot. The frequency
                parameter allows you to set how often the ad plays.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Can a VAST response contain multiple ads?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> No, the VAST module currently only supports a single
                    <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;Ad&gt;</samp> tag within a VAST response. Any additional ads
                will be ignored.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">VPAID FAQ</h2>
            
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What version of the VPAID standard does the Ooyala currently support?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong> Ooyala supports VPAID 1.0 standards.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: On what platforms is VPAID supported on the Ooyala player?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>VPAID is only supported on the Desktop Flash. </p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: How would I go about getting the VPAID plugin configured on my Ooyala player?</strong></p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Log into the <span class="ph">Ooyala <a class="xref" href="../../../../../../../contact.html" target="_blank">Customer Portal</a></span> and submit a
                ticket requesting that this ad source be added to your account. Once it's enabled
                you'll be able to create ad sets for VPAID.</p>
