                                        V4?</strong><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Ooyala's next generation video player
                                for HTML5 is designed to provide an engaging, personalized, content
                                aware, and robust video playback experience that is consistent
                                across devices and platforms. See <a class="xref" href="../concepts/pbv4_about.html">Player V4</a> for a full list of features.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q:
                                        How does Player V4 differ from earlier Ooyala
                                players?</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A:</strong> Player V4 has a responsive and
                                customizable UI that you can use out-of-the-box or customize to your
                                branding needs. It’s very simple to embed in your web site, with the
                                user interface configurable from our Backlot CMS. Its modular
                                architecture allows a wide range customizations, simply by
                                configuring the player in the Backlot UI, by modifying a JSON
                                configuration file, or even updating player CSS to make branding and
                                UI customizations perfect for your brand. </p>
<p class="p">While the Ooyala
                                Player V3 was a Flash-first player by default, Player V4 is built
                                and optimized for HTML5 playback. The Player V4 has built-in
                                Flash-failover as needed using the bit_wrapper.js plugin
                                (recommended), or OSMF plugin where Adobe Access DRM is still
                                needed. See <a class="xref" href="pbv4_dev_loadvideoplugins.html#pbv4_dev_loadvideoplugins__flash">Flash Video Rendering</a> for details on Flash video rendering.</p>
<p class="p">Player V4 is a
                                modular player consisting of plugins, which means that you can add
                                or remove certain functionality depending on which plugins you load
                                on your HTML page. The modular architecture of Player V4 allows for
                                a much smaller embed footprint, faster load times, and many more
                                customization options.</p>
<p class="p">Player V4 features a new <a class="xref" href="../concepts/pbv4_ads_framework.html">Ad Manager Framework</a>
                                with robust ad support, and an Analytics Framework that allows you
                                to integrate third-party analytics providers with the player. See

                        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Once I am up set up with Player V4, do I need to do continuous
                                        developer work to keep up with Ooyala monthly
                                releases?</strong></p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>No. If you are using the Ooyala Player V4 Standard embed code, or
                                the resource paths for Production or Production/Latest, then your
                                embed players will automatically get updates. Ooyala hosts two
                                release paths (production and latest, as described in <a class="xref" href="../concepts/pbv4_resources.html">Ooyala-hosted Player V4 Resources</a>) so that you are
                                automatically upgraded to the latest version on that path.</p>

                                <p class="p">If you are self-hosting (<a class="xref" href="../concepts/pbv4_host.html">Hosting Player V4 Resources</a>), all
                                you need to do is pull/clone the latest versions of the plugins and
                                player files. </p>

                        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Can I mix and match files from different release versions (for
                                        example, skin.json from 4.11.13 and ad_manager_vast.js from
                                        4.10.6)?</strong></p>

                        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>We strongly recommend using all files from the same release
                                version.</p>

                   <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: What does Player V4 have to do with the video mobile SDKs for iOS and Android?</strong></p>

                   <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Player V4 and the mobile SDKs for iOS and Android share the same
                                look and feel (skin). When we refer to the Player V4 skin, we are
                                referring typically to the skin.json file that can be used to apply
                                player UX to the HTML5 Player V4 and the mobile SDK players.
                                However, there are some differences in skin configurations that are
                                supported by platform.</p>

                   <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Q: Are there any special cases where Player V4 will be forced to load Flash
                                        instead of HTML5? In case the player is handling VPAID ads
                                        what would be the behavior? Will a Flash player be loaded at
                                        the beginning or only when serving the Ad? Would the actual
                                        content still be played in HTML5 player?</strong></p>

                   <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>The core player will <strong class="ph b">always</strong> be HTML5-based in Player V4. If
                                the selected encoding is not supported in HTML5 on a certain browser
                                and if Flash is supported, the main video will render in Flash. The
                                rest of the player including the UI will remain HTML5-based. For
                                VPAID 1.0, the VPAID ad will render in a Flash-based element, but
                                the rest of the player will remain HTML5-based, including the main
                                video, assuming the main video wasn't already playing in a Flash
                                renderer. See <a class="xref" href="pbv4_dev_loadvideoplugins.html#pbv4_dev_loadvideoplugins__flash">Flash Video Rendering</a> for details on Flash video rendering.</p>

                                order. Internally the player will look at what stream type is
                                available and what stream type is playable by the video plugins
                                you’ve loaded on the page and will try to play the first available

                        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>For many applications, you can use HLS for most common
                                scenarios. However, there are situations where using DASH can
                                provide better performance and/or additional capabilities such in
                                conjunction with Widevine Modular DRM. If DASH encoding is added to
                                your processing profile, you might have to re-process your assets in
                                order to leverage DASH encoding for your existing assets. Please
                                note that DASH migration is not mandatory. </p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Migrating assets to be HTML5-compatable stream formats can be
                                expensive and time-consuming. We are continuing to support Flash

                    expand to an extremely large size. What's happening? </strong></p>
<div class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Player V4 has new responsive design features. By default, as long as the container 's
                                width is bounded, the height will dynamically adjust according to
                                the video's aspect ratio. If you already know the aspect ratio of
                                the video, you can also try to override the skin.json setting to fix
                                the skin's aspect ratio. Change the value of
                                        <span class="keyword parmname">aspectRatio</span> (shown below) in skin.json
                                to your video's aspect ratio. You can calculate the aspect ratio
                                using height / width * 100. For a 4:3 video, 3 / 4 * 100 = 75, and

                                happening?</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>Our example on GitHub uses the
                                default skin.json file (see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/pbv4_resources.html">Ooyala-hosted Player V4 Resources</a>), which references 3 files:
                                config/es.json, config/en.json, and config/zh.json, which are our
                                default localization files for the player. If you want to use our
                                example out of the box, you'll need to get those files to resolve.
                                You can either download and modify skin.json to point to absolute
                                file paths, or copy the three language files into your website's
                                file structure (such as

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">A: </strong>If you are customizing the player and are now seeing the play
                                button appear as an 'h', then you likely have made reference to the
                                new location of the html5-skin.css file but not the necessary assets
                                directory (particularly the font files within the assets directory).
                                By hosting the assets directory in the same location as your
                                html5-skin.css file, you can resolve the missing icons and even
                                update the icons file with new icons of your own. </p>
