  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Basic Tutorial for Player V4</h1>

  <div class="body refbody">
      <div class="section">This tutorial walks you through the steps of adding a video with an Ooyala player onto a web page. It begins by configuring your player and video in Backlot, embedding the player on a web page, playing the video to verify your setup, and then configuring/testing additional Backlot settings. 
          <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This tutorial uses the default Ooyala configuration in the pure SAAS (software as a service) model, in which Ooyala hosts and maintains all resources (software paths, plugins, and skin resources) for you. This provides the simplest way to embed and deploy an Ooyala player. Ooyala bundes all the player resources, minifies, and automatically provides bug fixes and updates if this methodology is used.</div>

      </div>

      <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Before You Begin / Prerequisites</h2> Before you begin this tutorial, you
            should: <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Know how to edit HTML code on a web page.</li>

                <li class="li">Have a Backlot user account.</li>

                <li class="li">Upload a video into Backlot that you want to use.</li>

                <li class="li">Have a web page on which you want to add a player to run your video asset. </li>

            </ul>
 For background information, see <a class="xref" href="../concepts/pbv4_about.html">Player V4</a> and <a class="xref" href="../concepts/pbv4_gs.html">Getting Started with Player V4</a>. </div>

      <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 1: Log Into Backlot</h2>

      <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 2: Create a New Player</h2>
            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The player's API provides the <samp class="ph codeph">OO.ready</samp> method, which allows
                registering a callback function that is executed once the player core is fully
                loaded. It is a requirement of our API that player creation (i.e. calling
                    <samp class="ph codeph">OO.Player.create()</samp>) should not happen before
                    <samp class="ph codeph">OO.ready</samp> is called. For example:
                <pre class="pre codeblock">OO.ready(function() {
  player = OO.Player.create("<em class="ph i">container</em>", "<em class="ph i">YOUR_ASSET_ID</em>", playerParam);

                        an account after May 1st 2017, only Player V4 is an option. If for some
                        reason you need access to Player V3, please contact Ooyala Technical
                        Support.</div>

                <li class="li">On the Player tab, change the Player Name from New Player to something more
